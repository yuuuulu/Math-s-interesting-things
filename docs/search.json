(proof using Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:\nEvery integer greater than 1 is either a prime or can be uniquely factored into prime numbers.\nIf \\(n\\) is a prime number, then \\(r = n\\) and clearly \\(r \\mid n\\);\nIf \\(n\\) is not a prime number, it must be decomposable into a product of prime factors. Therefore, we can write: \\[\nn = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}\n\\]\nwhere \\(p_i\\) are prime numbers and \\(e_i\\) are positive integers.\nSince \\(n\\) is a product of prime factors, at least one of these prime factors \\(p_i\\) must divide \\(n\\).\nLet \\(r = p_i\\), which is one of the prime factors. Then \\(r \\mid n\\).\nThus, in both cases, whether \\(n\\) is a prime or not, there exists at least one prime number \\(r\\) such that \\(r \\mid n\\).)\nThus \\[\nr \\mid m^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r \\mid m\n\\] (proof of \\[\nr \\mid m^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r \\mid m\n\\]: proof1 using prime factorization as method 1’s:\n\\(r \\mid m^2\\) and r is a prime so \\(r=p_i\\) corresponding to the exponential of \\(2a_i\\)\nsince \\(a_i \\geq 0\\), so \\(a_i\\) is at least 1 . proof2 using if r is a prime and r|ab, then r|a or r|b:\nSuppose \\(r \\nmid a\\) and \\(r \\nmid b\\) (contradiction assumption).\nLet \\(\\gcd(a \\cdot b, r) = d\\) (where \\(d\\) is the greatest common divisor of \\(a \\cdot b\\) and \\(r\\)).\nSince \\(d \\mid r\\), \\(d\\) is a divisor of \\(r\\) (since \\(r\\) is a prime number).\nTherefore, \\(d\\) is either \\(r\\) or \\(1\\) (since \\(r\\) is prime).\nif \\(d = r\\), we have \\(\\gcd(a \\cdot b, r) = r\\). This implies \\(r \\mid a \\cdot b\\).\nSince we assumed \\(r \\nmid a\\) and \\(r \\nmid b\\), it contradicts our initial statement based on Properties of greatest common divisor with its proof using Bezou’s theorem;\nIf \\(d = 1\\), we have \\(\\gcd(a \\cdot b, r) = 1\\). This implies \\(r \\nmid a \\cdot b\\), which contradicts our assumption that \\(r \\mid a \\cdot b\\).\nThus, the contradiction shows that our assumption \\(r \\nmid a\\) and \\(r \\nmid b\\) must be false. Therefore, \\(r\\) must divide at least one of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n)\nSince \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, this leads to a contradiction.\nTherefore, \\(\\sqrt{p}\\) must be an irrational number."

    "text": "Professor. Wang Duo, a very charismatic and responsible Calculus teacher who has worked for our country in the area of math for at least 50 years (which was his target before and he has realized his dream!), always says “You should try to solve one problem many times with new methods to handle and understand knowledge better”\nFor math learning, focusing too much on exams is not so meaningful. We should experience its beauty from the bottom of our hearts. I did not reach my target in the Multivariable Calculus and the Linear Algebra models, but Dr. Bohuan Lin said:“Exams (especially written exams) require one to figure out solutions within a very short time period, and moreover, under an intense atmosphere. From my point of view, it is really not a problem if one fails to solve those difficult and nonstandard problems under such a condition. Of course, for math study (so as for the study of other things), we should not be satisfied with merely being able to solve”standard problems”, but just try to challenge and improve yourself with deep/difficult questions under a daily condition with a natural mood, since this is the common situation in which you will be working on various tasks in your future career. ”\nThere are many ways to solve problems, and all of them are interesting when multiple integrals occur."
