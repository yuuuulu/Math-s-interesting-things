# Integrating factor is the translation of the diffrentiation operation

$y'+ky = f(x)$ is just $(D+k)y=f(x)$--> y=1/(D+k)f(x)

- idea : integrating factor and exact differential

$e^{kx} (y'+ky) =e^{kx} f(x)$


$ye^{kx} = \int e^{kx} f(x) dx$

y= $\frac{1}{e^{kx}} \int e^{kx} f(x) dx$ = $e^{-kx} \int e^{kx} f(x) dx$

So the solution of y = $\frac{1}{e^{kx}} \int e^{kx} f(x) dx$ is the same as the solution of y=1/(D+k)f(x)


eg. $1/(D-2) (xe^x) = e^{-2x} \int e^{x} e^{2x} x dx = e^{-2x} \int e^{3x} x dx = e^{-2x} (e^{3x} (1/3)x - 1/9 e^{3x}) = 1/3 x e^x - 1/9 e^x$





# Plz write the Cauchy-Euler equation as the simplest one and THEN use the method of variation of parameters!!!

# Motivation from Professor Chi-Kun Lin: Differential equations reveal the secrets of nature even before we solve them. DEs are really related to the nature.

## Eg of Variation of Parameters introduced by Professor Chi-Kun Lin:

The method of variation of parameters is a clever and elegant approach in solving non-homogeneous differential equations, especially in the context of physics. When we consider a differential equation, the non-homogeneous term F(x) can be seen as an external force acting on the system. In the absence of this force, the solution space of the homogeneous equation is spanned by a set of linearly independent solutions, such as $y_1$ and $y_2$. These solutions form the basis of the homogeneous solution through linear combinations.

However, when the external force $F(x)$ is introduced, it perturbs the system and necessitates the inclusion of a particular solution that specifically responds to this force. This particular solution still involves the original basis functions $y_1$ and $y_2$, but it introduces new coefficients $u_1(x)$ and $u_2(x)$ that are functions of the independent variable $x$. These coefficients are not constants; instead, they vary in a way that reflects the influence of the external force. The idea is that these coefficients $u_1(x)$ and $u_2(x)$ can be adjusted to account for the systematic changes induced by the physical quantity represented by $F(x)$.

The brilliance of the variation of parameters method lies in its ability to construct a particular solution by allowing these coefficients to vary. This method hypothesizes that by introducing these variable coefficients, the particular solution can effectively capture the response of the system to the external force. And indeed, this construction turns out to be effective. It provides a systematic way to find a particular solution that complements the homogeneous solution, thereby giving us the complete solution to the non-homogeneous differential equation. The name “variation of parameters” aptly describes the essence of this method, emphasizing the dynamic adjustment of the parameters (coefficients) in response to the external force.

## Eg of the behind story of "Euler-Lagrange Equation"

$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial q^{`}\alpha}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q \alpha}$

While it's often said that Lagrange was Euler's student and that Euler had already discovered some of Lagrange's work but chose not to publish to allow Lagrange to gain recognition, the reality of their relationship was a bit more nuanced.

Euler was indeed supportive of Lagrange's work and recognized his talent. At the age of 19, Lagrange had made significant contributions to mathematics that caught Euler's attention. Lagrange sent Euler his work on the calculus of variations, and Euler was very supportive. He recognized Lagrange’s talents and helped introduce him to the wider mathematical community.

Euler held back his own work on the calculus of variations to let Lagrange publish first. When Euler left Berlin for St. Petersburg in 1766, he recommended that Lagrange succeed him as the director of the Berlin Academy. This act was seen as a testament to Euler's generous spirit and his recognition of Lagrange's abilities.

# Intro

## To study ODEs and PDEs, the thinking way of Linear Algebra should be used!

$x^{(2)}$= x'' = $\frac {d^2 x}{dy^2}$--this notation of the second order's is actually share the same idea of "division"

## Order

## Liniarity

\$a_n(x) \frac{d^n y}{dx^n } + ... +a_1(x) \frac{d y}{dx } +a_0(x)y =g(x) \$

-   eg

(y-x)dx+4xdy=0

-   $\frac {d^2 y}{dx^2}+\sin y=0$ is not linear since it has nonlinear function of y

## solution of an ODE

### ? why continuous? ---

An funtion defined on an interval I and possessing at least **n derivatives that are continuous on I**, which when substituted into an nth-order ordinary differential equation reduces the equation to an identity, is said to be a solution of the equation on the interval.

We cannot think solution of an ordinary differential equation without simultaneously thinking interval.

### trivial solution --y=0, I

### Solution Curve SEE CODEs

### Explicit and implicit solution shape of ODEs

### Singular solution

### A solution of a system

System:

$$\cases{^{{\frac{dx}{dt}}=f(t,x,y)} _{\frac{dy}{dt}=g(t,x,y)}}$$ Solution: x =$\Phi_1(t)$, y=$\Phi_2(t)$ defined on a common interval I that satisfy each equation of the system on this interval.

On some interval I containing $x_0$, the problems of solving an nth-order DE subject to n side conditions (initial conditions (IC)) specified at $x_0$

## Existence and Uniqueness

Does a solution of the problem exist? If a solution exists, is it unique?

![](images/clipboard-381625365.png)

## Interval of Existence and Uniqueness

Suppose y(x) represents a solution of the first order initial- value problem. The following three sets on the real x-axis may not be the same:

the domain of the function y(x), D

the interval I over which the solution y(x) is defined or exists,

and the interval $I_0$ of existence and uniqueness.

$I_0 \subseteq I \subseteq D$

# Differential Equations as Mathematical Models

## Newton's law

# Autonomous 1st Order DEs

for y(x): $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(y)$

Critical Points (equilibrium point/ stationary point)--f(y)=0

-   eg. Population increase model

$\frac{dp}{dt} = p(a-bp)$

let f(p)=p(a-bp)=0 and catogorize the x-axis based on it, discussing the different situation intuitively

## Properties of the solutions of autonomous DE

## ? Translation Property--only autonomous DEs has this property?

-   meaning: translation?
-   ![](images/clipboard-1854338105.png)

If y(x) is a solution of an autonomous differential equation dy ∕dx = f(y), then y1(x) = y(x − k) (y of (x-k)), k a constant, is also a solution.

# Separable Equations

$\frac {dy}{dx}=g(x)h(y)$

## singular solution

$\frac {dy}{h(y)}=g(x)dx$. If r is a zero of the function h(y), substituting y=r into dy/dx=g(x)h(y) makes both sides zero (y = r is a constant solution of the differential equation). As a consequence, y = r might not show up in the family of solutions that are obtained after integration and simplification. Such a solution is called a singular solution.

# Linear equation

$a_1(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+a_0(x)y=g(x)$ is said to be a linear equation in the variable y.

-   standard form:

$\frac{dy}{dx}+P(x)y=f(x)$

## Integrating factor method

### solution

idea: want to written into $\frac{d}{dx}()=f(x)$ then we assume after multiplying a factor $\mu(x)$ we can write $\frac{d}{dx}(\mu(x)y(x))=\mu(x)f(x)$

we get $\mu(x) = ce^{\int{p(x)dx}{}}$.

let c=1 we get the integrating factor

## Homogeneous Linear System



Just follow the idea in $y''+my'+ny=0$, when facing the linear system $\cases{{\vec {x'} = A\vec x}\\{ay'+by=0}}$, we also assume that $\vec {x'} = \vec ke^{\lambda t}$ and substitute it into $\vec {x'} = Ax$


## phase portrait and stable/ unstable / semi-stable points

## ? JORDAN FORM AND ODE system?

When we solve $ay''+by'+cy=0$ if m is a double root, then $y_1=e^{mx}$, $y_2=xe^{mx}$

Naturally, here we assume $\vec x_2 =\vec k t e^{\lambda t}$, substitute $\vec x_2$ into the system $\vec {x'} = Ax$;

LHS = $\vec {x_2'} = \vec k(e^{\lambda t }+\lambda te^{\lambda t})=A\vec x_2$=$A\vec k t e^{\lambda t}$ =RHS

Then we get $\vec k = \vec 0$. 

So our assumption is not true.
