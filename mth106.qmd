# Intro

## To study ODEs and PDEs, the thinking way of Linear Algebra should be used!

$x^{(2)}$= x'' = $\frac {d^2 x}{dy^2}$--this notation of the second order's is actually share the same idea of "division"

## Order

## Liniarity

$a_n(x) \frac{d^n y}{dx^n } + ... +a_1(x) \frac{d y}{dx } +a_0(x)y =g(x) $

-   eg

(y-x)dx+4xdy=0

-   $\frac {d^2 y}{dx^2}+\sin y=0$ is not linear since it has nonlinear function of y

## solution of an ODE

### ? why continuous? ---

An funtion defined on an interval I and possessing at least **n derivatives that are continuous on I**, which when substituted into an nth-order ordinary differential equation reduces the equation to an identity, is said to be a solution of the equation on the interval.

We cannot think solution of an ordinary differential equation without simultaneously thinking interval.

### trivial solution --y=0, I

### Solution Curve SEE CODEs

### Explicit and implicit solution shape of ODEs

### Singular solution

### A solution of a system

System:

$$\cases{^{{\frac{dx}{dt}}=f(t,x,y)} _{\frac{dy}{dt}=g(t,x,y)}}$$ Solution: x =$\Phi_1(t)$, y=$\Phi_2(t)$ defined on a common interval I that satisfy each equation of the system on this interval.

# Initial Value Problem --codes

-   def

On some interval I containing $x_0$, the problems of solving an nth-order DE subject to n side conditions (initial conditions (IC)) specified at $x_0$

## Existence and Uniqueness

Does a solution of the problem exist? If a solution exists, is it unique?

## Interval of Existence and Uniqueness

Suppose y(x) represents a solution of the first order initial- value problem. The following three sets on the real x-axis may not be the same:

the domain of the function y(x), D

the interval I over which the solution y(x) is defined or exists,

and the interval $I_0$ of existence and uniqueness.

$I_0 \subseteq I \subseteq D$

# Differential Equations as Mathematical Models

## Newton's law

# Autonomous 1st Order DEs

for y(x): $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(y)$

Critical Points (equilibrium point/ stationary point)--f(y)=0

-   eg. Population increase model

$\frac{dp}{dt} = p(a-bp)$

let f(p)=p(a-bp)=0 and catogorize the x-axis based on it, discussing the different situation intuitively

## Properties of the solutions of autonomous DE

-   A solution curve

## ? Translation Property--only autonomous DEs has this property?

-   meaning: translation?

If y(x) is a solution of an autonomous differential equation dy ∕dx = f(y), then y1(x) = y(x − k) (y of (x-k)), k a constant, is also a solution.

# Separable Equations

$\frac {dy}{dx}=g(x)h(y)$

## singular solution

$\frac {dy}{h(y)}=g(x)dx$. If r is a zero of the function h(y), substituting y=r into dy/dx=g(x)h(y) makes both sides zero (y = r is a constant solution of the differential equation). As a consequence, y = r might not show up in the family of solutions that are obtained after integration and simplification. Such a solution is called a singular solution.

## initial value problem

### intergral-defined function

# Linear equation

$a_1(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+a_0(x)y=g(x)$ is said to be a linear equation in the variable y.

-   standard form:

$\frac{dy}{dx}+P(x)y=f(x)$



## Integrating factor method

### solution

idea: want to written into $\frac{d}{dx}()=f(x)$ then we assume after multiplying a factor $\mu(x)$ we can write $\frac{d}{dx}(\mu(x)y(x))=\mu(x)f(x)$

we get $\mu(x) = ce^{\int^{p(x)dx}{}}$.

let c=1 we get the integrating factor

## Exact equations


z=f(x,y)=c


## Non-exact



# Bernouli's equation

DO Not Remember--understand it instead!

just want to transform the equation to a 1st order differential equation to solve it using integrating factor method.
