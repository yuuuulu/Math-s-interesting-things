### Real R space

A matrix A in this space is a real matrix, which maps vectors in $\mathbb{R^n}$ to another vector in $\mathbb{R^n}$ through multiplication: $$
A: \mathbb{R^n} \to \mathbb{R^n}
$$ $$
A \cdot v = w \in \mathbb{R^n}
$$

**real matrix**

**concrete**

### Abstract vector space over R or C

linear transformation: $$
T: V \to W
$$ **abstract and more general vector space over** $\mathbb{R^n}$ or $\mathbb{C^n}$

## Notations

$$
a \in A
$$ eg. $$
3 \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

$\emptyset$

Two sets A and B are equal if and only if they contain the same elements: $$
A = B
$$ if and only if $$
\forall x \, (x \in A \iff x \in B)
$$ $$
A \subseteq B
$$ intersection: $$
A \cap B
$$ union: $$
A \cup B
$$

## Maps

**maps(functions)**

$$
f: A \to B, \quad a \mapsto f(a)
$$ composition: Given two functions $f: B \to C$ and $g: A \to B$, the composition of f and g is denoted as: $$
(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)), \quad \text{for all} \, x \in A
$$

$$
a \mapsto c(a \mapsto b \mapsto c)
$$

### injective--one to one

if $a_1 \neq a_2$ then $f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)$

if $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$, then $a_1=a_2$

### surjective--onto

for $f: A \to B$

$$
\forall b \in B, \, \exists a \in A \, \text{such that} \, f(a) = b
$$

### bijetive--both inj and suj

for $f: A \to B$ $$
\forall b \in B, \, \exists! a \in A \, \text{such that} \, f(a) = b
$$ （use $\exists!$expresses only exist one）

## subsets,inclusions, restrictions

### subsets

$A \subseteq B$

### empty set is a subset of every set B.

$$
\emptyset \to B
$$

### inclusion

if A $\subseteq$ B, we have a map: $$
\iota: A \to B
$$

$$
\iota(a) = a
$$, called the inclusion of A (into B)

### restriction

the reason to define it:

For example, consider a map $g: B \to C$, where the function takes each element $x$ and maps it to $x + 2$. Let the sets be as follows:

-   $A = \mathbb{N} \subseteq B = \mathbb{R}$

-   $C = \mathbb{R}$ is the codomain of the function.

The map $g$ is defined as: $$ g: B \to C, \quad g(x) = x + 2 \quad \text{for all } x \in B $$

Now, consider the restriction of $g$ to $A$, denoted $g|_A: A \to C$, where: $$ g|_A: A \to C, \quad g|_A(x) = x + 2 \quad \text{for all } x \in A $$

Although both $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $g|_A: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ follow the same rule $x \mapsto x + 2$, they cannot be considered the same map because their domains differ.

(here, A $\subseteq$ B)

That is:

if A $\subseteq$ B and $f:B \to C$, we have a map for all a $\in$ A: $$
f|_A: A \to C
$$:

$$
f|_A(a) = f(a)
$$ called the restriction of f to A

$$
f|_A = f \circ \iota_A
$$ because $$
f \circ \iota_A(a)=f(\iota_A(a))=f(a)=f|_A(a)
$$

### set of all maps from A to B

if a and b are sets we define B\^A={f:A---B map} the set of all maps from A to B

$$
B^A = \{ f: A \to B \}
$$ $B^\emptyset = \{ \emptyset \to B \}$ has only 1 element even if B=$\emptyset$

### ?

so the last one F could be random / each , not limit to F right? if it is not F, the element is not definaty 0?

proof: suppose f,g $\in$ $B^\emptyset = \{f: \emptyset \to B \}$, imagine f != g, we can derive $\exists x \in \emptyset$ s.t. f(x) != g(x), which is absurd, so f=g

if B is F, suppose the only one element is sth.:

sth. should follow the quality of the set, which is:

sth. + sth. = sth.

$\lambda$sth. =sth.

so sth. = 0

#### cardinality

\|A\|: number of elements in A(set)

if A and B are finite sets #A=n #B=m, then $|B^A| = m^n$

# Chapter 1: vector spaces

## finite space

For finite spaces ,only R\^n and C\^n.

**(For infinite spaces, there are many, e.g. a continuous set: \[0,1\] to ...)**

## R\^n notification

$$
\mathbb{R}^n = \{ (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \mid x_i \in \mathbb{R} \text{ for } i = 1, 2, \dots, n \}
$$ real numbers

### define 2 oprations on the set R\^n

addition: $$
(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) + (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n) = (x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2, \dots, x_n + y_n)
$$

-   **Left-hand side**: $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n), (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$

-   **Right-hand side**: The result of $x_i + y_i$ is in $\mathbb{R}$.

scalar multiplication: for lambda $\in$ R,

$$
\lambda \cdot (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = (\lambda x_1, \lambda x_2, \dots, \lambda x_n)
$$

-   **Left-hand side**: $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}, (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$.

-   **Right-hand side**: The result $\lambda x_i \in \mathbb{R}$, for each i.

these 2 oprations generalize the standard operations on R2 and R3

#### geometric realization

矢量三角形--addition

直线上--scalar multiplication

mention: for n greater than or equal to 4 we cannot visualize vectors in the real world but e can still use them to solove real world problems

if a and b are finite sets

### to simplify notations we sometimes use a single letter for vectors:

x= $\vec x$ =(x_1,x_2,....)

R\^n as a vector space

so we have(rn,+, mutiplication notation). the operations satisfies some useful properties that turn rn into a real vector space

## relation between it and + $\cdot$

it means that + and $\cdot$ satisfy the following axioms:

1)  $\forall x,y \in rn$: x+y=y+x. commutativity

2)  $\forall x,y,z \in rn$: (x+y)+z=x+(y+z). associativity

3)  x + 0 = 0 + x neutral element for addition

4)  $x + (-x) = (-x) + x = 0$ inverse for addition -x=y

5)  $1 \cdot x = x$ Identity Element for Scalar Multiplication

6)  $(\lambda \mu) \cdot x = \lambda \cdot (\mu \cdot x)$ compatibilily of multiplication

7)  $\lambda \cdot (x + y) = \lambda \cdot x + \lambda \cdot y$ Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication Over Vector Addition

8)  $(\lambda + \mu) \cdot x = \lambda \cdot x + \mu \cdot x$ Distributivity of Scalar Addition

### ?

want to ensure **if a set satisfies the 2 operations it is not satisfy all 1-8 axioms instead of F\^n**

## complex Vector Space

$i^2 = -1$

Define $\mathbb {C}^n$ as the set of all ordered n-tuples of complex numbers: $$
\mathbb{C}^n = \{ (z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n) \mid z_i \in \mathbb{C}, \, i = 1, 2, \dots, n \}
$$

### Operations on C\^n

We define **addition** and **scalar multiplication** on $\mathbb{C}^n$ in the same way as we did on $\mathbb{R}^n$, but using complex numbers:

#### Addition:

For two vectors $(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n)$ and $(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n$:

$$
(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n) + (w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n) = (z_1 + w_1, z_2 + w_2, \dots, z_n + w_n)
$$

#### Scalar Multiplication:

For a scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ and a vector $(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n$:

$$
\lambda \cdot (z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n) = (\lambda z_1, \lambda z_2, \dots, \lambda z_n)
$$

### Complex Vector Space

Thus, $(\mathbb{C}^n, +, \cdot)$ is a complex vector space because it satisfies the vector space axioms 1-8, where we replaced $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\mathbb{C}^n$. Many of the results from MTH107 will hold regardless of whether we are using $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, so we will often use $\mathbb{F}$ to represent either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

For example, $\mathbb{F}^n$ is an $\mathbb{F}$-vector space, where $\mathbb{F}$ could be either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

### Generalization (Not on the Exam):

#### Finite Field Example:

$\mathbb{F}_2 = \{0, 1\}$: the finite field with two elements.

Many of our results hold in a more general setting, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a **field**—a set in which we can perform addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division (except division by zero).

Examples of fields include:

-   $\mathbb{R}$: the real numbers
-   $\mathbb{C}$: the complex numbers
-   $\mathbb{Q}$: the rational numbers
-   $\mathbb{F}_2 = \{0, 1\}$: the finite field with two elements

### Abstract Vector Space:

We can generalize this idea by replacing $\mathbb{F}^n$ with some abstract space $V$, define addition $+$ and scalar multiplication $\cdot$, and check if they satisfy the eight vector space axioms.

### Definitions:

For a set $V$, **addition** on $V$ is a map:

$$
V \times V \to V
$$

It maps an element set to their addition. For example, if $V = \mathbb{R}^2$:

$$
(v, w) \mapsto v + w
$$

Example: $(1,2) + (3,4) = (4,6)$, which is also in $V$.

A **scalar multiplication** is a map:

$$
F \times V \to V
$$

For example, $(\lambda, v) \mapsto \lambda v$.

An $F$-vector space is a set $V$ with an addition $+$ and scalar multiplication $\cdot$ by elements of $F$, such that $(V, +, \cdot)$ satisfies the vector space axioms 1-8, where $\mathbb{R}$ is replaced by $F$, and $\mathbb{R}^n$ is replaced by $V$.

### Remarks and Examples:

-   **Vectors**: Vectors are elements of $V$, denoted as $v \in V$.
-   **Field** $F$: The choice of $F$ matters! For example, we will see later that $\mathbb{C}^n$ is a complex vector space of dimension $n$, but is also a real vector space of dimension $2n$.

ensure: they are not F but the spaces made of by F

### Examples:

For any field $F$,

1.  **Trivial Vector Space**: the set $V = \{0\}$ is a trivial $F$-vector space with addition $0 + 0 = 0$ and scalar multiplication $\lambda \cdot 0 = 0$.

2.  **Finite-Dimensional Vector Space**: $F^n$ is an $F$-vector space, and $F^0 = \{0\}$.

3.  **Infinite-Dimensional Vector Space**: Let $F^\infty$ be the space of infinite sequences, where:

$$
F^\infty = \{ (x_1, x_2, \dots) \mid x_i \in F, \, i = 1, 2, \dots \}
$$

Addition and scalar multiplication are defined **component-wise**:

$$
(x_1, x_2, \dots) + (y_1, y_2, \dots) = (x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2, \dots)
$$

4.  **Function Space**: Let $S$ be a set, then:

$$
F^S = \{ f: S \to F \, \text{(maps from S to F)} \}
$$

Addition and scalar multiplication are defined **pointwise**. For functions $f, g \in F^S$ and $\lambda \in F$:

$$
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) \quad \forall x \in S
$$

$$
(\lambda \cdot f)(x) = \lambda \cdot f(x) \quad \forall x \in S
$$

### Special Cases:

1.  **Empty Set**: If $S = \emptyset$, then:

$$
F^{\emptyset} = \{ 0 \}
$$

The set $F^{\emptyset}$ contains only the zero function.

2.  **Finite Set**: If $S = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, then:

$$
F^{\{1, 2, \dots, n\}} = F^n
$$
