# linear regression

## it is not stable to predict the data outside our data sample'

## Residual plost should have no pattern

across the whole range, it could not be showing a certain trend or a specific shape.

positive and negative points sperate averagely .


# skew

mean is much sensitive than the median so the outlier drags the mean to the skew......

dotplot没有纵轴in r(vs scallar plot)

price of a textbook is discrete

zip code is categorical

dotplot and scallar plot

do not manipulate data---experimental

cluster/stratified

stratified: according to certain carecteristic

cluster: randomly groups

huge data for 顺序的 shuffle is ok

but ..

the likelihood is totally different

# The role of statistics and the Data Analysis Process

## Intro

stat is a large field in math involving the collection, organization, analysis,interpretation, and presentation of data(a collection of observations on one or more variables(A characteristic whose value may change from one observation to another))

Statistics is the scientific discipline that provides methods to help us make sense of data.

It is important to be able to:

1 Extract information from tables, charts, and graphs.

2 Follow numerical arguments.

3 Understand the basics of how data should be gathered, summarized, and analysed to draw statistical conclusions.

The Data Analysis Process

1 Understanding the nature of the research problem or goals.

2 Deciding what to measure and how.

3 Collecting data.

4 Data summarization and preliminary analysis.

5 Formal Data Analysis (Statistical Methods).

6 Interpretation of the results.

## populations and samples

population: The entire collection of individuals or objects about which information is desired

sample: A sample is a subset of the population, selected for study.

then select the sample

then we could summarize it using 2 branches of stat.--- Decriptive stat.(methods for organizing and summarizing data.) or inferential stat.(generalizing from a sample(incomplete information) to the population from which the sample was selected and assessing the reliability of such generalizations.So we run the risk(An important aspect of statistics and making statistics inferences involves quantifying the chance of making an incorrect conclusions.))

### descriptive stat

### inferential stat

sample

## Types of data

### uni data set and bivariate and multivariate

### categorical and numerical(discrete and continuous) with plot using excel (data analysis) or rstudio plot (ggplot2)

for categorial data we could use a bar chart which is a graph of a frequency distribution for categorical data.

for a small numerical data we could use dotplot

-   discrete
