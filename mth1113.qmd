# bivariate data

# linear regression

## it is not stable to predict the data outside our data sample'

## Residual plost should have no pattern

across the whole range, it could not be showing a certain trend or a specific shape.

positive and negative points sperate averagely .

# skew

mean is much sensitive than the median so the outlier drags the mean to the skew...... ![](images/clipboard-2849357671.png)

As long as we know the mean and standard deviation of the data, we can determine how far a certain proportion of the data falls, without knowing the specific distribution shape of the data.

# outlier (eg of normal distribution)

a mild outlier if it lies more than 1.5(iqr) away from the nearest quartile (the nearest end of the box);

an extreme outlier if it lies more than 3(iqr) away from the nearest quartile.

(These definitions and distances are based on the hypothetical Normal distribution (bell shaped, symmetric, normal tails). When there is a reason to suspect that the distribution is skewed, the bounds should be changed.)

# modified boxplot

A modified boxplot is a box plot where the whiskers only extend to the largest (or smallest) observation that is not an outlier and the outliers are plotted using a full circle (mild) or empty circle (extreme).

If there are no outliers, then the the whiskers end at the maximum (or minimum)

# The role of statistics and the Data Analysis Process

## Intro

stat is a large field in math involving the collection, organization, analysis,interpretation, and presentation of data(a collection of observations on one or more variables(A characteristic whose value may change from one observation to another))

Statistics is the scientific discipline that provides methods to help us make sense of data.

It is important to be able to:

1 Extract information from tables, charts, and graphs.

2 Follow numerical arguments.

3 Understand the basics of how data should be gathered, summarized, and analysed to draw statistical conclusions.

The Data Analysis Process

1 Understanding the nature of the research problem or goals.

2 Deciding what to measure and how.

3 Collecting data.

4 Data summarization and preliminary analysis.

5 Formal Data Analysis (Statistical Methods).

6 Interpretation of the results.

## populations and samples

population: The entire collection of individuals or objects about which information is desired

sample: A sample is a subset of the population, selected for study.

then select the sample

then we could summarize it using 2 branches of stat.--- Decriptive stat.(methods for organizing and summarizing data.) or inferential stat.(generalizing from a sample(incomplete information) to the population from which the sample was selected and assessing the reliability of such generalizations.So we run the risk(An important aspect of statistics and making statistics inferences involves quantifying the chance of making an incorrect conclusions.))

### descriptive stat

### inferential stat

sample

## Types of data

### uni data set and bivariate and multivariate

### categorical and numerical(discrete and continuous) with plot using excel (data analysis) or rstudio plot (ggplot2)

for categorial data we could use a bar chart which is a graph of a frequency distribution for categorical data.

for a small numerical data we could use dotplot

## collect data sensibly

# chapter 2

## Two types of studies: Observational studies and Experiments.

### Observational

A study in which the investigator observes characteristics of a sample selected from one or more existing populations. The goal is to draw conclusions about the corresponding population or about differences between two or more populations.

In an observational study, it is impossible to draw clear cause-and-effect conclusions

### Experiments

A study in which the investigator observes how a response variable behaves when one or more explanatory variables, also called factors, are manipulated.

A well-designed experiment can result in data that provide evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship.

![](images/clipboard-858121668.png)

-   Experimental conditions: Any particular combination of values for the explanatory variables, which are also called treatments.

### comparison

-   Both observational studies and experiments can be used to compare groups, but in an experiment the researcher controls who is in which group, whereas this is not the case in an observational study.

-   In an observational study, it is impossible to draw clear cause-andeffect conclusions

### confounding vars

A variable that is related to both how the experimental groups were formed and the response variable of interest.

-   Two methods for data collection: Sampling and Experimentation.

-   distinguish between selection bias, measurement or response bias, and non-response bias.

-   select a simple random sample from a given population.

-   distinguish between simple random sampling, stratified random sampling, cluster sampling, systematic sampling, and convenience sampling

## variable

### response variable--y

The response variable is the focus of a question in a study or experiment.

### explanotory variable--x

An explanatory variable is one that explains for changes in the response variable.

### experiments and obeservational study

### bias

selection bias：When the way the sample is selected systematically excludes some part of the population of interest.

measurement or response bias

eg: survey question/scale(The scale or a machine used for measurements is not calibrated properly)

Non-response Bias:When responses are not obtained from all individuals selected for inclusion in the sample.

non-response bias can distort results if those who respond differ in important ways from those who do not respond (e.g. laziness a confounding variable).

### random sampling

def: A sample that is selected from a population in a way that ensures that every different possible sample of size n has the same chance of being selected.

the same chance to be selected

counter eg:

Consider 100 students in a classroom, 60 females and 40 males. If we randomly sample 6 females, and 4 males, then each female has a 6/60 = 0.1 chance of being selected. Same for males, 4/40=0.1. However, not every group of 10 students is equally likely to be selected. This is not simple random sampling

The random selection process allows us to be confident that the sample adequately reflects the population, even when the sample consists of only a small fraction of the population.

eg.Voting Sample Size in a country

### stratified and cluster

-   stratified random sampling:In stratified random sampling, separate simple random samples are independently selected from each subgroup. Each subgroup is called a strata.

In general, it is much easier to produce relatively accurate estimates of characteristics of a homogeneous group than of a heterogeneous group.

stratified: according to certain characteristic

eg.Even with a small sample, it is possible to obtain an accurate estimate of the average grade point average (GPA) of students graduating with high honours from a university (Similar high grades, homogenous, thus only sample a few students). On the other hand, producing a reasonably accurate estimate of the average GPA of all seniors at the university, a much more diverse group of GPAs, is a more difficult task. **Not only does this ensure that students at each GPA level are represented, it also allows for a more accurate estimate of the overall average GPA.**

-   cluster reflect general characteristic about the whole entire population

cluster: randomly groups

Cluster sampling involves dividing the population of interest into non-overlapping subgroups, called clusters. Clusters are then selected at random, and then all individuals in the selected clusters are included in the sample.

### systematic sampling

A value k is specified (e.g. k = 50 or k = 200). Then one of the first k individuals is selected at random, after which every k-th individual in the sequence is included in the sample. A sample selected in this way is called a 1 in k systematic sample.

In the case of large samples, it can ensure that the sample is evenly distributed in the population.
