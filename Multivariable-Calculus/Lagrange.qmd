### Problem

Find extreme values of 

$$ f(x, y) = \cos x + \cos y + \cos (x + y). $$

### Solution

Since cosine is a periodic function, we can consider the region \( 0 \leq x \leq 2\pi \), \( 0 \leq y \leq 2\pi \) (bounded and closed region) to find the maximal and minimal values.

Firstly, we consider the interior of the region to find stationary points:

$$ f_x = -\sin x - \sin (x + y) = 0 $$
$$ f_y = -\sin y - \sin (x + y) = 0 $$

This implies:

$$ \sin x = \sin y $$

Then, inside the region (not on boundary), we have three cases:

1. \( y = x \)
2. \( y = \pi - x \) for \( 0 < x < \pi \)
3. \( y = 3\pi - x \) for \( \pi < x < 2\pi \)

#### Case 1

$$ \sin x + \sin (x + y) = \sin x + 2 \sin x \cos x = 0 $$
$$ \sin x (2 \cos x + 1) = 0 $$

This implies:

$$ x = \pi, y = \pi $$
or
$$ x = \frac{2\pi}{3}, y = \frac{2\pi}{3} $$
or
$$ x = \frac{4\pi}{3}, y = \frac{4\pi}{3} $$

Evaluating the function at these points:

$$ f(\pi, \pi) = -1 $$
$$ f\left( \frac{2\pi}{3}, \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{3}{2} $$
$$ f\left( \frac{4\pi}{3}, \frac{4\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{3}{2} $$

#### Case 2

$$ \sin x + \sin (x + y) = \sin x + \sin \pi = \sin x = 0 $$

This implies:

$$ x = \pi, y = 0 $$ (on boundary)

#### Case 3

$$ \sin x + \sin (3\pi - x) = \sin x = 0 $$

This implies:

$$ x = \pi, y = 2\pi $$ (also on boundary)

### On the Boundary

Due to periodic property, we consider:

$$ x = 0, 0 \leq y \leq 2\pi $$
and
$$ y = 0, 0 \leq x \leq 2\pi $$

Evaluating the function at these boundaries:

$$ f(0, y) = 1 + 2 \cos y, \min = -1, \max = 3 $$
$$ f(x, 0) = 1 + 2 \cos x, \min = -1, \max = 3 $$

So, 

$$ \max f(x, y) = 3 \text{ at } (2n\pi, 2k\pi) \text{ for any } n, k \in \mathbb{Z} $$
$$ \min f(x, y) = -\frac{3}{2} \text{ at } \left( (2n+1)\pi \pm \frac{\pi}{3}, (2k+1)\pi \pm \frac{\pi}{3} \right) $$
