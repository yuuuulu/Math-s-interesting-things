title: "one application problem about directional derivative and gradient"
---
Thanks to Boyun Pang to let me know this interesting question and thanks to Dr. Wang to teach me such clever method.
The temperature \( T \) in degrees Celsius at \((x, y, z)\) is given by

$T = \frac{10}{{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$

where distances are in meters. A bee is flying away from the hot spot at the origin on a spiral path so that its position vector at time \( t \) seconds is
$\mathbf{r}(t) = t \cos(\pi t) \mathbf{i} + t \sin(\pi t) \mathbf{j} + t \mathbf{k}$

Determine the rate of change of \( T \) in each case:

1. With respect to distance traveled at time \( t=1 \).
2. With respect to time at \( t = 1 \).

(Think of two ways to do this.)


$$
\frac{dT}{dS} = \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{R}'(S)
$$


$$
\frac{dT}{dS} = f_x \cdot x'(S) + f_y \cdot y'(S) + f_z \cdot z'(S)
$$


$$
||\vec{r(t)}||=\int_{0}^{t} \sqrt{x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2} \, dt = S(t)
$$

$$
\mathbf{r}(t(S)) = \mathbf{R}(S)
$$

$$
\vec{R(S)}' =\mathbf{r}(t(S)) \mathbf{t}(S)=\mathbf{r}(t(S))\frac{1}{\mathbf{S}(t)}(inverse function)
=\frac{\mathbf{r}’(t)}{||\mathbf{r}’(t)||}
$$


$$
\mathbf{R}'(S) = \frac{\mathbf{r}'(t(S)) \cdot t'(S)}{\sqrt{x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2}}
$$


$$
\mathbf{R}(t) = \mathbf{r}(t)
$$
