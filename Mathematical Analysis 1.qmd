everything must be a reason during the process of proof. Patience is
necessary!

real number

# history

Ancient Greece philosophy

Pythagoras, Archimede, Euclide,etc.

maths behave a discpline

study maths for its own sake! - number theory Q: rational number: a/b,
a,b $\in$ Z, b no 0

Greek believes: "Atoms"--Q are all numbers

-   geometry (length of sig $\in Q$)

discovery: $\sqrt 2$ in a square or ... is not rational---kill

--- no understanding of real number, irrational infinity... no
corresponding of number and geometry

parallel---square using move

but it is not a possible thing to turn a circle into a square---$\pi$ is
not a rational number -----paradox: zhinuo and wugui----convergence of a
sum (they do not understand infinity and real number)

# calculus

Newton Leibniz makes phy a idependent discipline

Newton's Law--Kepler Law solve ODE:$GMm/r^2=F=ma=mr^{..}$

Philosophiae Naturalis Principil Mathematica. every theorem and lemma
are detailed proved

--no understanding of real number but a little understanding of limit
and infinity

# analysis 19 century

Cauchy cantor weierstrass hilbert

understand real number infinity limit

the foundation of maths

# Chaper 1: Logic(grammar) v.s. Maths(literature)

we should solve out logic first to logic important in--programming(some
derivations of maths)

## statement

p

### ---An assertion that is either true or false but not both

e.g.

#### Negation of a statement p is a statement which means the opposite of P

\~p----read "not p"

#### Quantifiers

all, every, each,no(none)---universal quantifiers

some,there exists, there is at least on, etc.---existential quantifiers

P: *some* a's are b's

\~P: *all* a's are not b's/ no a's are b's

P: *some* a are not b

\~p: *all* a are b

#### Truth table: give the truth values of related statements in all possible cases

(relevant to boolean in computer science)

``` python
# Example of boolean logic in a program
is_raining = True
has_umbrella = False

if is_raining and not has_umbrella: # which is the only situation that implication fails
    print("You need an umbrella!")
else:
    print("You're good to go!")
```

compound statement: combining several statements via logical operations

Conjunction: p\^q. p and q

Disjunction: p v q--p or q

one of them is true, p v q is true, so we only need to decide if oe of
them is true, if it is, the p v q is true

p V (\~p) is always true

a statement that is always true is called a tautology

## P10,1.4

Equivalence of statements: Two statements are **logically equivalent**,
if they have the same truth values in all possible situations.

$A\equiv B$

'abstract non-sense'

**Them(De Morgan's laws)**

A,B

$\sim (A \land B) \equiv (\sim A) \lor (\sim B)$

$\sim (A \lor B) \equiv (\sim A) \land (\sim B)$

draw truth table to look at values

交的话（and），都T才T；并的话（or），1T则T

**Conditional:**

If p(hypothesis/assumption/condition), then
q(conclusion/consequence/result).

read: p implies q/assume p, then q.

key point: the implication is False when the rule is broken

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
A & B & A \rightarrow B \\
\hline
T & T & T \\
T & F & F \\
F & T & T \\
F & F & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$ **Def:** p, q,p--\>q

1)Converse: q---\>p,i.e. if q, then p

2)Contrapositive: (~q)--\>(~p), i.e. if not q, then not p

**Prop:** (p--\>q)$\equiv$ ((~q)--\>(~p))(a statement and its
contrapositive are logically equivalent) $$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
p & q & \sim p & \sim q & p \rightarrow q & \sim q \rightarrow \sim p & (p \rightarrow q) \equiv (\sim q \rightarrow \sim p) \\
\hline
T & T & F & F & T & T & T \\
T & F & F & T & F & F & T \\
F & T & T & F & T & T & T \\
F & F & T & T & T & T & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

(always remember: implication fails only when the rule brokens instead
of......(others))

**Proof by contradiction**: we want to prove p---\>q, we prove
(~q)----\>(~p) instead

proof: Assume \~q, if , then if , then ... --\> \~p, which is contradict
to the original assumption p

```         
   Hence the assumption ~q is false, i.e. q is true.#
   
```

e.g.: n is a natural number. Prove that if n\^2 is divisible by 2(p),
then n is divisible by 2(q).

Proof: Assume that n is not divisible by 2(\~q),---\> n is
odd(defination), i.e. n =2k+1,k$\in Z$

---\> n\^2 =(2k+1)\^2(multiplicaiton)=2()+1, which is odd

---\> n\^2 is not divisible by 2(\~p),

Thus the aassumption that n is not divisible by 2 is false so n is
divisible by 2.#

**biconditional:** p,q,

(p--\>q)$\land$(q---\>p)---p \<--\> q----reads‘p if and only if q’.

statement converse

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
p & q & p \rightarrow q & q \rightarrow p & p \leftrightarrow q \\
\hline
T & T & T & T & T \\
T & F & F & T & F \\
F & T & T & F & F \\
F & F & T & T & T \\
\hline
\end{array}

## Countability and Bijections

Countable Set: A set is said to be countable if it is either finite or
has the same size (cardinality) as the set of natural numbers
$\mathbb{N}$. A set is countably infinite if there exists a bijection (a
one-to-one correspondence) between that set and $\mathbb{N}$.

Uncountable Set: A set is uncountable if no such bijection exists,
meaning its cardinality is strictly greater than that of $\mathbb{N}$.

Bijection: A bijection between two sets $A$ and $B$ is a function
$f: A \to B$ that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

### The Problem: Showing that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is Uncountable

The question asks you to prove that the power set of natural numbers
$\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$, i.e., the set of all subsets of $\mathbb{N}$,
is uncountable. To prove this, you are guided to assume a contradiction:
that there is a bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.

Hint: Suppose there is a bijection f : N → P(N). Consider the set {n ∈
N\| n ∈/ f(n)} to deduce a contradiction.

method 1: Consider the set
$A = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n \notin f(n) \}$, f : N → P(N).

we should prove it is not a bijection. so we could prove it is not
surjective(P(N) is much bigger than N).

now we ask if f is surjective:

If yes, there exists $n_0\in N$ s.t. f(n_0)=A

now we ask: Doer $n_o\in f(n_0)$

1)  if yes, $n_0\notin A=f(n_0)$

2)  if no, $n_0\in A=f(n_0)$

so f is not surjective, which means f could not be bijective. so p(N) is
uncountable.

-   eg of a bijection between 2 sets(namely 2 sets with the same size)

N-\>Z

n\|-\>n/2 if n even

n\|-\> n+1/2 if n odd

method 2:

The hint in the problem suggests using a classical argument known as
Cantor's diagonal argument:

Assume there is a bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$:
This means each natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is paired with a
unique subset of $\mathbb{N}$, i.e., $f(n) \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.
Consider the set $S = { n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n \notin f(n) }$: This set
$S$ contains all natural numbers that are not elements of their
corresponding subset given by the function $f$. Deriving a
Contradiction: $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, so by the assumption of
a bijection, there must be some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f(m) = S$.
Now, ask whether $m \in S$ or $m \notin S$:

If $m \in S$, then by the definition of $S$, we must have
$m \notin f(m)$, which contradicts the fact that $f(m) = S$.

If $m \notin S$, then $m$ must be an element of $f(m)$, which again
contradicts the definition of $S$.

Since this contradiction arises, we conclude that no such bijection
$f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ can exist, and therefore
$\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable.

The power set $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable, meaning its
cardinality is greater than that of the set of natural numbers
$\mathbb{N}$, even though both sets are infinite. This conclusion is a
key result in set theory, demonstrating that not all infinite sets have
the same "size" or cardinality.

### an eg question-Logical Puzzle on Truth of Statements relavent to truth table

Consider the following 99 statements:

-   $S_1$: "Among these 99 statements, there is at most one true
    statement."
-   $S_2$: "Among these 99 statements, there are at most two true
    statements."
-   ...
-   $S_{99}$: "Among these 99 statements, there are at most 99 true
    statements."

The goal is to determine which statements among these 99 are true.

(hint:Consider the chain of implications from statement $S_n$ to
$S_{n+1}$. Which statement implies which? )

sol: we fail the hypothesis of $S_{n+1}\Rightarrow S_n$，but because

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
S_n & S_{n+1} & S_n \Rightarrow S_{n+1} \\
\hline
T & T & T \\
T & F & F \\
F & T & T \\
F & F & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Thus, we conclude that the truth of $S_n$ implies the truth of all
subsequent statements $S_{n+1}$.

)

$$
S_n \Rightarrow S_{n+1}
$$ so there exists an $S_n$, after which are true while before which are
false.

so:There are $100 - n$ true statements.

$$
100 - n \leq n \implies n \geq 50
$$

There are $n - 1$ false statements.

$$
n - 1+1\leq 100 - n \implies n \leq 50
$$ so The 50th statement $S_{50}$ is true. Statements $S_1$ to $S_{49}$
are false, and statements $S_{50}$ to $S_{99}$ are true.


## Cardinality
- numebr of elements in a finite set: Def: let A be a set, if A contains finitely many elements, then the number of elements of A is called the cardinality of A, denoted by |A|(|A|$\in Z_{\geq0}$


- A, B have infinitely many elements. If $\exists f:A->B$ is a bijective map, then we regard the A, B have the same "cardinality", i.e.|A|=|B|

## A x B--Cartesian product

### eg

|A|=3, |B|=2, |A x B|=6


## map

Question from the Cardinality:

What happens if A has infinitely many elements?


Def: LEt A and B be 2 sets, A map(function)f: A-->B assigns each element in A

there has 3 kinds of maps(see 107)

### eg

the graph of f(x) in A x B is f: A--> B(x $\in A$,y$\in B$)

## inverse defination


if f is a bijective map, so as $f^{-1}$.

## countable

- A set A is called countable if A iseither a finite set of there exists a bijective map f: A to N.(Otherwise is uncountable)



### eg

- $B=[x|x=2n,n\in N$ is countable 


proof: for x|-->x/2 of B-->N
       i) injective , $\forall x_1 $  not = $x_2$, f(x_1)=x/2, \= f(x_2)

       ii) surjective, $\forall y\in N $, $\exists x\in B$ s.t. ,f(2y)=x, $2y\in B$
       
       so bijective
       


- Z is countable (负无穷到正无穷范围内的整数)

f:N-->Z(n|-->n/2 if even,  1-n/2 if odd)


n|-->n/2 if even makes the positive integer possible

1-n/2 if odd makes negative integer possible

and both of them are bijections


so Z is countable

   
    
       


# the real number

















# a problem about divisible using greatest common factor to solve(even Bezou's theorem)

Q:"Proof that if a positive integer $p$ is not a perfect square, then
$\sqrt{p}$ is irrational."

Sol: Proof by Contradiction:

Assume $\sqrt{p}$ is rational.

Since $p$ is not a perfect square, there exist two coprime positive
integers $m$ and $n$ with $n > 1$ such that $$
\sqrt{p} = \frac{m}{n}
$$

Then $$
p = \frac{m^2}{n^2}
$$

which implies $$
m^2 = n^2 p
$$ i.e. $n^2 \mid m^2$. Then We want to show that $n \mid m$:

Suppose $m^2 = k n^2$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Since $m$ and $n$ are both integers, based on prime factorization, we
have:

$$
m = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}
$$

$$
n = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \cdots p_k^{b_k}
$$

where $p_i$ are prime numbers, and $a_i, b_i$ are non-negative integers.

So,

$$
m^2 = p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \cdots p_k^{2a_k}
$$

and

$$
n^2 = p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \cdots p_k^{2b_k}
$$

Since $m^2 = k n^2$, we have:

$$
p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \cdots p_k^{2a_k} = k \cdot p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \cdots p_k^{2b_k}
$$

This implies:

$$
2a_i \geq 2b_i \quad \text{for all } i
$$

So,

$$
a_i \geq b_i \quad \text{for all } i
$$

Thus, $m$ is divisible by $n$. Therefore, $n \mid m$, which is opposite
to m and n are coprime. So, $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational.

method 2: Proof by Contradiction:

Assume $\sqrt{p}$ is rational.

Since $p$ is not a perfect square, there exist two coprime positive
integers $m$ and $n$ with $n > 1$ such that $$
\sqrt{p} = \frac{m}{n}
$$

Then $$
p = \frac{m^2}{n^2}
$$

which implies $$
m^2 = n^2 p
$$ i.e. $n^2 \mid m^2$. So $n \mid m^2$

Since $n > 1$, it follows that there exists a prime number $r$ such that
$r \mid n$. (proof using Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:

Every integer greater than 1 is either a prime or can be uniquely
factored into prime numbers.

If $n$ is a prime number, then $r = n$ and clearly $r \mid n$;

If $n$ is not a prime number, it must be decomposable into a product of
prime factors. Therefore, we can write: $$
n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}
$$

where $p_i$ are prime numbers and $e_i$ are positive integers.

Since $n$ is a product of prime factors, at least one of these prime
factors $p_i$ must divide $n$.

Let $r = p_i$, which is one of the prime factors. Then $r \mid n$.

Thus, in both cases, whether $n$ is a prime or not, there exists at
least one prime number $r$ such that $r \mid n$.)

Thus $$
r \mid m^2 \quad \text{and} \quad r \mid m
$$ (proof of $$
r \mid m^2 \quad \text{and} \quad r \mid m
$$: proof1 using prime factorization as method 1's:

$r \mid m^2$ and r is a prime so $r=p_i$ corresponding to the
exponential of $2a_i$

since $a_i \geq 0$, so $a_i$ is at least 1 . proof2 using if r is a
prime and r\|ab, then r\|a or r\|b:

Suppose $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$ (contradiction assumption).

Let $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = d$ (where $d$ is the greatest common divisor
of $a \cdot b$ and $r$).

Since $d \mid r$, $d$ is a divisor of $r$ (since $r$ is a prime number).

Therefore, $d$ is either $r$ or $1$ (since $r$ is prime).

if $d = r$, we have $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = r$. This implies
$r \mid a \cdot b$.

Since we assumed $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$, it contradicts our initial
statement based on Properties of greatest common divisor with its proof
using Bezou's theorem;

If $d = 1$, we have $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = 1$. This implies
$r \nmid a \cdot b$, which contradicts our assumption that
$r \mid a \cdot b$.

Thus, the contradiction shows that our assumption $r \nmid a$ and
$r \nmid b$ must be false. Therefore, $r$ must divide at least one of
$a$ or $b$.

)

Since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, this leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, $\sqrt{p}$ must be an irrational number.
