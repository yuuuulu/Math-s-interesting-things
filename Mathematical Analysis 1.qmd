## if a not empty set has upper bound, then it must have the unique sup.

**Prove: if a not empty set has upper bound, then it must have the
unique sup.**

Method 1: (Completeness axiom) $$
\begin{gathered}
X \neq \phi, \quad Y=\{y \in \mathbb{R} \mid \forall x \in X(x \leq y)\} \neq \phi \\
\\
\forall x \in X, \forall y \in Y, x \leq y \\
\\
\Rightarrow \exists c \in \mathbb R, \forall x \in X, \forall y \in Y, \\
\\
x \leqslant c \leqslant y(\text { Completeness axiom) } \\
\\
\Rightarrow(c \in Y) \wedge(\{\forall y \in Y \mid y \geqslant c\}) \\
\\
\Rightarrow c=\min Y
\end{gathered}
$$

So $c$ is the only sup. (uniqueness of minimum element of a set---2 inequalities lead to the equality leading to the only one result).

Method 2: Cantor Nested Interval Property(limit思想).

We choose a random upper bound $\gamma, x \in E($ the set) $$
[x, r]=\left[a_1 b_1\right] \supset\left[a_2, b_2\right] \supset \cdots \left[a_n, b_n\right]
$$ (each time we use the method of bisection to choose one side
Including the point in $E$ ) \$\$

```{=tex}
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Since }\left[a_1, b_1\right] \supset\left[a_2, b_2\right] \cdots, b_n-a_n=\frac{\gamma-x}{2^{n-1}} \rightarrow 0, \\
& \beta \in\left[a_n, b_n\right],(n=1,2, \cdots), \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} b_n=\beta \text {(limit thinking of the Cantor Nested Interval) } \\
& \Rightarrow \forall c \in E, c \leqslant b_n \Rightarrow c \leqslant \beta \text { (E }  \text {is never on the right of} [a_n,b_n]) \\
& \Rightarrow \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists d \in E, d>\beta-\varepsilon\text { (each} [a_n,b_n] \text { has points in E.(or see the attached picture to see more picisely))}
\end{aligned}
```

**Prove: if a not empty set has lower bound, then it must have the
unique inf.**

Method 1: same as before.

Method 2: Based on before.

Suppose We choose $m$ as a lower bound of $E$. $$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \forall x \in E, x \geqslant m,-x \leqslant-m \text {. } \\
& \text { Let } F=\{-x \mid x \in E\} \text {. } \\
& \Rightarrow \beta=\sup F \\
& \Rightarrow-x \leqslant \beta, x \geqslant-\beta \text {. } \\
& \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists-d \in E,-d>\beta-\varepsilon, \\
& \Rightarrow d<-\beta+\varepsilon \\
& \Rightarrow-\beta=\inf E
\end{aligned}
$$ $$
\Rightarrow-\sup (-E)=\operatorname{inf} E \text {. }
$$

### if c is negative then inf(cA)=csupA

**Method 3:more generalized than Method 2's conclusion**

In fact, If $c<0$, then
$\sup (cA)=\operatorname{cinf} A, \inf (c A)=\operatorname{csup} A$.
(and **in particular. sup** $(-B)=-$ inf $B$ )

Since if M=supA, $\forall x\in A,x\leq M,cx\geq cM$, which indicates
that cM is the lower bound of cX.

So, $cA$ has lower bound ( $s$ )if and only if $A$ has upper
bound(s).(inverse, also true) $cA$ is not empty if and only if A is not
empty.

So, cA has $\inf (cA)$ if and only if $A$ has supA $$
\begin{aligned}
& \forall c x \in C A, c x \geqslant c M \\
& \text { if } \exists c M, \forall c x \in c A, c x \geqslant c M^{\prime}, c M^{\prime}>c M, \\
& X \leq M^{\prime}, M^{\prime}<M(\forall x \in A)
\end{aligned}
$$

Contradicting to the condition that $M=\sup A$

So $\nexists C M^{\prime}$ So cM is the largest lower bound $$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { so } c M=\inf (c A) \\
& \text { so } c\sup A=\inf (c A)
\end{aligned}
$$
## exercise: (1,2]'s sup--



### Method 1

- 2 is an upper bound of [1,2) (obviously)
- if $\exists \varepsilon>0$, s.t $1-\varepsilon$ is also an upper bound of $[1,2)$
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \because 1 \in[1,2) \\
& \therefore1-\varepsilon \geqslant 1
\end{aligned}
$$
choose $1-\frac{\varepsilon}{2} \in(1-\varepsilon, 2)$
Then $1-\frac{\varepsilon}{2} \in[1,2)$
So $\exists\left(1-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right) \in[1,2)$ while $\left(1-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)>(1-\varepsilon)$
So $1-\varepsilon$ is not an upper bound, contradicting to the suppose.
So we have proved that 2 is the smallest upper bound,
i.e. $\sup [1,2)=2$.

### Method 2
- 2 is an upper bound of [1,2) (obviously)
- $\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists b \in[1,2)$ with $b>2-\varepsilon$. We can take $b=\max \left\{2-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}, 1\right\}$.




## exercise: supC=sup(A+B)=supA+supB from Professor A Kun

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\text { if } A\subset R,  B\subset R, \text { define: } \\
C  :=A+B=\{z \in R: z=x+y, x \in A, y \in B\} \\
D  :=A-B=\{z \in R: z=x-y, x \in A, y \in B\}
\end{array}
$$ show that $$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { (1) } \sup C=\sup (A+B)=\sup A+\sup B \\
& \text { (2) } \sup D=\sup (A-B)=\sup A-\inf B
\end{aligned}
$$ (1) Proof:: Obviously,$C$ has upper bounds if and only if $A$ and $B$
have upper bounds, and $C$ is not empty. So $C$ has sup C if and only if
and only if $A$ has sup $A$ and $B$ has sup $B$. (Completeness axiom).

-   prove: $\sup C \leqslant \sin A+\sup B$. $$
    \because x+y \leqslant \sup A+\sup  B
    $$ $\therefore(\operatorname{sip} A+\sup B)$ is an upper bound of
    $C$ $$
    \therefore \sin C \leqslant \sin A+\sup B
    $$
-   Prove : $\sup C \geqslant \operatorname{supA}+$ sup B $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & \because \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists x \in A, y \in B \text {, s.t. } \\
    & \operatorname{sup} A-\varepsilon<x, \operatorname{sup} B-\varepsilon<y . \\
    & \Rightarrow \sup A+\sup B-2 \varepsilon<x+y \\
    & \text { i.e. }(\operatorname{sup} A+\sup B-2 \varepsilon)_{\text {max }}<(x+y)_{\text {max }}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Since $x+y \leq$ sup c We have
$\sup A+\sup B-2 \varepsilon<\sup c, \forall \varepsilon>0$ $$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { i.e. } \operatorname{(sup} A+\sup B-2 \varepsilon)_{\text {max }}<\sup C \\
\end{aligned}
$$

We. As $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, We have
$\operatorname{sup} A+\sup B \leqslant \operatorname{} \operatorname{sup} C$
So, we have
$\operatorname{Sup} C=\operatorname{Sup} A+\operatorname{Sup} B$. Then,
we have $\sup D=\sup (A-B)$ $$
\begin{aligned}
& =\sup (A+(-B)) \\
& =\sup A+\sup (-B) \\
& =\sup A-\inf B
\end{aligned}
$$ (We have proved $\sup (-B)=-\inf B$ before)

### another example
     Let M ∈ R and A, B be two bounded, negative subsets of R,0 < x, y < M, ∀x ∈ A, y ∈ B
    when we are proving sup C = sup(AB) = sup A · sup B
    On the other hand, from the definition of $a^*$ and $b^*, \forall \epsilon>0$ there exist $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ such that
$$
a^*-\epsilon<a<a^* \quad \text { and } \quad b^*-\epsilon<b<b^*
$$

Then
$$
\left(a^*-\epsilon\right)\left(b^*-\epsilon\right)<a b \leqslant a^* b^*
$$
or ignoring $\epsilon^2$ term (If ε > 0, then ε, 3ε, ε², ε⁵, they all represent "any number greater than zero", and ε' also represents any number greater than zero, so they are equivalent, that is, we can say that they are equal to ε'.)
$$
a^* b^*-(a+b) \epsilon=a^* b^*-\epsilon^{\prime}<a b \leq c^*
$$

This is true for all $\epsilon^{\prime}>0$, so
$$
\sup A \sup B=a^* b^* \leq c^*=\sup C
$$

Combining the above two inequalities, we can conclude that $\sup A \sup B=$ $\sup C$.
## an exercise about think good Archimedean number from Professor Andrew Lin(A Kun)

13. Consider the set $$
    A=\left\{\left.(-1)^n\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right) \right\rvert\, n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\right\} .
    $$

-   Show that 1 is an upper bound for $A$.
-   Show that if $d$ is an upper bound for $A$, then $d \geq 1$.
-   Use (a) and (b) to show that $\sup A=1$. \[Solution\]:
-   We will show that for any $x \in A, x \leq 1$. Since $x \in A$, then
    $x=(-1)^n(1-$ $1 / n$ ) for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Since
    $\frac{1}{n}>0$, then $1-\frac{1}{n}<1$. We argue our desired
    inequality in two cases. If $n$ is even, then
    $x=(-1)^n(1-1 / n)=1-1 / n<1$. If $n$ is odd, then
    $x=(-1)^n(1-1 / n)=-1+1 / n<0<1$. In either case, $x \leq 1$ (in
    fact, $x<1$ ) and 1 is an upper bound for $A$.
-   Let $d$ be an upper bound for $A$. Thus, $(-1)^n(1-1 / n) \leq d$
    for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Assume, to the contrary that $d<1$.
    Thus, $1-d>0$. By the Archimedean Property, there exists an
    $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$such that $1<(1-d) n$. Since $n>0$, we can
    rewrite this as $\frac{1}{n}<1-d$, which is equivalent to
    $d<1-\frac{1}{n}$. If $n$ is even, then $(-1)^n=1$ and we have that
    $$
    d<(-1)^n\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right) \in A
    $$ contradicting the fact that $d$ is an upper bound. If $n$ is odd,
    then consider instead $n+1$, which is even. Then, $(-1)^{n+1}=1$ and
    $$
    d<1-\frac{1}{n}<(-1)^{n+1}\left(1-\frac{1}{n+1}\right) \in A
    $$

This again contradicts that $d$ is an upper bound for $A$. Either way,
we reach a contradiction and therefore conclude that $d \geq 1$.

-   obviously

lower bound + inequaility ---smallest upper bound---sup

## another exercise about another episilon from Professor A Kun

14. Find the least upper bound for the following set and $$
    A=\left\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \cdots, \frac{n}{n+1}, \cdots\right\}
    $$ \[Solution\]: We note that every element of $A$ is less than 1
    since $$
    \frac{n}{n+1}<1, \quad n=1,2,3, \cdots
    $$

We claim that the least upper bound is $1, \sup A=1$. Assume that 1 is
not the least upper bound. Then there is an $\epsilon>0$ such that
$1-\epsilon$ is also an upper bound. However, we claim that there is a
natural number $n$ such that $$
1-\epsilon<\frac{n}{n+1}
$$

This inequality is equivalent to the following sequence of inequalities
$$
1-\frac{n}{n+1}<\epsilon \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \frac{1}{\epsilon}-1<n
$$

Reversing the above sequence of inequalities shows that if
$n>\frac{1}{\epsilon}-1$, then $1-\epsilon<\frac{n}{n+1}$ showing that
$1-\epsilon$ is not an upper bound for $A$.

(if n \> 1/ $\epsilon$-1, $\nexists \epsilon$ s.t. 1-$\epsilon$ is an
upper bound, contradicting to our suppose)

This verifies our answer.

## Prove Cantor Nested Interval Property

**Prove:**

-   $\exists c \in$ all closed internals

    -   i.e. if the non-empty closed intervals
        $I_1 \supset I_2 \supset I_3 \cdots, \exists c \in R$, s.t.
        $c\in I_i, \forall i \in \mathbb{N}$, $c \in$
        $\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} I_i$

-   If the limit of the lengths of these intervals are 0 then the point
    is unique

    -   i.e. if$\left|I_n\right| \rightarrow 0$, c is unique

$$
\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists I_n(|I_n| < \varepsilon) \Rightarrow c \text { ! }
$$

**Proof**:

-   proof of 1

$I_1=[a_1, b_1]$

claim $\forall I_n=[a_n, b_n], I_m=[a_m, b_m]$ i.e. $a_n \leq b_m$

(if $a_n>b_m$, then $a_m \leq b_m<a_n<b_n$, which means they are
separate internals without any intersection.) $$
\begin{aligned}
&\text { Let } X=\left\{a_n\right\} (\text { left endpoint set) } \\
&\text { Let } Y=\left\{b_m\right\}(\text { right endpoint set) } \\
& \forall a_n \in X, \forall b_m \in Y, a_n \leq c\leq b_m
\end{aligned}
$$ $\Rightarrow \exists c \in \mathbb{R}$, s.t., $\forall a_n \in X$
$\forall b_m \in Y,a_n\leqslant b_m$.(completeness axiom) We then let
$m=n \Rightarrow c \in I_n$

-   proof of 2

**Based on “Any implication is equivalent to its contrapositive”**

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { if } \exists c_1<c_2, \text { s.t. } c_1, c_2 \in I_n, \\
& \forall n \in \mathbb{R}, a_n \leqslant c_1<c_2 \leqslant b_n, \\
& \Rightarrow\left|I_n\right|=b_n-a_n \geqslant c_2-c_1
\end{aligned}
$$

We then choose $\varepsilon=\frac{c_2-c_1}{2}>0$

then there exists no $I_n$ s.t. $\left|I_n\right|<\varepsilon$, since

$|I_n|\geqslant c_2-c_1 \geqslant \frac{c_2-c_1}{2}$

So if $\exists I_n s. t .\left|I_n\right|<\varepsilon$, $c!$

## prove finite covering lemma

**Prove：Finite Covering Lemma** $$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Def: } S:=\{X\}, \text { ( } x \text { is a set) } \\
Y \subset \bigcup_{X \in S} X
\end{gathered}
$$

We say. $S$ is a cover of $Y$. $$
\text { i.e. } \forall y \in Y, \exists X \in S,(y \in X)
$$

Finite Covering Lemma:

If $I:[a, b]$, $$
I \subset \bigcup_{n \in I} U_n, U_n=\left(\alpha_n, \beta_n\right)
$$ $\exists U_1, \cdots U_k$, s.t., $I\subset \bigcup_{i=1}^k U_i$

**（Summray of Finite Covering Lemma: A closed internal can be covered
by finite number of open internals）**

**proof:**

suppose $I=[a, b]$ could not be coverd by finite number open intervals:

Then we use the method of bisection to separate I,s.t.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& I=I_1 \supset I_2 \supset I_3 \cdots I_n \supset \cdots \text { ( all In can not be covered } \\
& \left|I_n\right|=\frac{b-a}{2^n} \rightarrow 0 \\
& \text { Gover) } \\
& \Rightarrow \exists: C \in \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} I_i \text { (Cantor Nested Interral Property) } \\
& c_i\in[a_i,b_i]\\
& \Rightarrow C\in I\subset \bigcup U_i\text {(based on the given condition of the proof problem)}\\
& \Rightarrow \exists U=[\alpha,\beta],s.t.c\in U，let ：\varepsilon =min[c-\alpha,\beta-c]\\
& \Rightarrow I_n\subset U
\end{aligned}
$$

![](images/clipboard-4085119236.png)

which indicates that at least this $I_n$ is covered by U, contradicting
to the suppose.

so the finite covering lemma is true.

## Countability and Bijections

Countable Set: A set is said to be countable if it is either finite or
has the same size (cardinality) as the set of natural numbers
$\mathbb{N}$. A set is countably infinite if there exists a bijection (a
one-to-one correspondence) between that set and $\mathbb{N}$.

Uncountable Set: A set is uncountable if no such bijection exists,
meaning its cardinality is strictly greater than that of $\mathbb{N}$.

Bijection: A bijection between two sets $A$ and $B$ is a function
$f: A \to B$ that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

### The Problem: Showing that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is Uncountable

The question asks you to prove that the power set of natural numbers
$\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$, i.e., the set of all subsets of $\mathbb{N}$,
is uncountable. To prove this, you are guided to assume a contradiction:
that there is a bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.

Hint: Suppose there is a bijection f : N → P(N). Consider the set {n ∈
N\| n ∈/ f(n)} to deduce a contradiction.

method 1: Consider the set
$A = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n \notin f(n) \}$, f : N → P(N).

we should prove it is not a bijection. so we could prove it is not
surjective(P(N) is much bigger than N).

now we ask if f is surjective:

If yes, there exists $n_0\in N$ s.t. f(n_0)=A

now we ask: Doer $n_o\in f(n_0)$

1)  if yes, $n_0\notin A=f(n_0)$

2)  if no, $n_0\in A=f(n_0)$

so f is not surjective, which means f could not be bijective. so p(N) is
uncountable.

-   eg of a bijection between 2 sets(namely 2 sets with the same size)

N-\>Z

n\|-\>n/2 if n even

n\|-\> n+1/2 if n odd

method 2:

The hint in the problem suggests using a classical argument known as
Cantor's diagonal argument:

Assume there is a bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$:
This means each natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is paired with a
unique subset of $\mathbb{N}$, i.e., $f(n) \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.
Consider the set $S = { n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n \notin f(n) }$: This set
$S$ contains all natural numbers that are not elements of their
corresponding subset given by the function $f$. Deriving a
Contradiction: $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, so by the assumption of
a bijection, there must be some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f(m) = S$.
Now, ask whether $m \in S$ or $m \notin S$:

If $m \in S$, then by the definition of $S$, we must have
$m \notin f(m)$, which contradicts the fact that $f(m) = S$.

If $m \notin S$, then $m$ must be an element of $f(m)$, which again
contradicts the definition of $S$.

Since this contradiction arises, we conclude that no such bijection
$f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ can exist, and therefore
$\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable.

The power set $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable, meaning its
cardinality is greater than that of the set of natural numbers
$\mathbb{N}$, even though both sets are infinite. This conclusion is a
key result in set theory, demonstrating that not all infinite sets have
the same "size" or cardinality.

### an eg question-Logical Puzzle on Truth of Statements relavent to truth table

Consider the following 99 statements:

-   $S_1$: "Among these 99 statements, there is at most one true
    statement."
-   $S_2$: "Among these 99 statements, there are at most two true
    statements."
-   ...
-   $S_{99}$: "Among these 99 statements, there are at most 99 true
    statements."

The goal is to determine which statements among these 99 are true.

(hint:Consider the chain of implications from statement $S_n$ to
$S_{n+1}$. Which statement implies which? )

sol: we fail the hypothesis of $S_{n+1}\Rightarrow S_n$，but because

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
S_n & S_{n+1} & S_n \Rightarrow S_{n+1} \\
\hline
T & T & T \\
T & F & F \\
F & T & T \\
F & F & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Thus, we conclude that the truth of $S_n$ implies the truth of all
subsequent statements $S_{n+1}$.

)

$$
S_n \Rightarrow S_{n+1}
$$ so there exists an $S_n$, after which are true while before which are
false.

so:There are $100 - n$ true statements.

$$
100 - n \leq n \implies n \geq 50
$$

There are $n - 1$ false statements.

$$
n - 1+1\leq 100 - n \implies n \leq 50
$$ so The 50th statement $S_{50}$ is true. Statements $S_1$ to $S_{49}$
are false, and statements $S_{50}$ to $S_{99}$ are true.

## Cardinality

-   numebr of elements in a finite set: Def: let A be a set, if A
    contains finitely many elements, then the number of elements of A is
    called the cardinality of A, denoted by \|A\|(\|A\|$\in Z_{\geq0}$

-   A, B have infinitely many elements. If $\exists f:A->B$ is a
    bijective map, then we regard the A, B have the same "cardinality",
    i.e.\|A\|=\|B\|

## A x B--Cartesian product

### eg

\|A\|=3, \|B\|=2, \|A x B\|=6

## map

Question from the Cardinality:

What happens if A has infinitely many elements?

Def: LEt A and B be 2 sets, A map(function)f: A--\>B assigns each
element in A

there has 3 kinds of maps(see 107)

### eg

the graph of f(x) in A x B is f: A--\> B(x $\in A$,y$\in B$)

## inverse defination

if f is a bijective map, so as $f^{-1}$.

## countable

-   A set A is called countable if A iseither a finite set of there
    exists a bijective map f: A to N.(Otherwise is uncountable)

### eg

-   $B=[x|x=2n,n\in N$ is countable

proof: for x\|--\>x/2 of B--\>N i) injective , \$\forall x_1 \$ not =
$x_2$, f(x_1)=x/2, = f(x_2)

```         
   ii) surjective, $\forall y\in N $, $\exists x\in B$ s.t. ,f(2y)=x, $2y\in B$
   
   so bijective
   
```

-   Z is countable (负无穷到正无穷范围内的整数)

f:N--\>Z(n\|--\>n/2 if even, 1-n/2 if odd)

n\|--\>n/2 if even makes the positive integer possible

1-n/2 if odd makes negative integer possible

and both of them are bijections

so Z is countable

Q:"Proof that if a positive integer $p$ is not a perfect square, then
$\sqrt{p}$ is irrational."

Sol: Proof by Contradiction:

Assume $\sqrt{p}$ is rational.

Since $p$ is not a perfect square, there exist two coprime positive
integers $m$ and $n$ with $n > 1$ such that $$
\sqrt{p} = \frac{m}{n}
$$

Then $$
p = \frac{m^2}{n^2}
$$

which implies $$
m^2 = n^2 p
$$ i.e. $n^2 \mid m^2$. Then We want to show that $n \mid m$:

Suppose $m^2 = k n^2$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Since $m$ and $n$ are both integers, based on prime factorization, we
have:

$$
m = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}
$$

$$
n = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \cdots p_k^{b_k}
$$

where $p_i$ are prime numbers, and $a_i, b_i$ are non-negative integers.

So,

$$
m^2 = p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \cdots p_k^{2a_k}
$$

and

$$
n^2 = p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \cdots p_k^{2b_k}
$$

Since $m^2 = k n^2$, we have:

$$
p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \cdots p_k^{2a_k} = k \cdot p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \cdots p_k^{2b_k}
$$

This implies:

$$
2a_i \geq 2b_i \quad \text{for all } i
$$

So,

$$
a_i \geq b_i \quad \text{for all } i
$$

Thus, $m$ is divisible by $n$. Therefore, $n \mid m$, which is opposite
to m and n are coprime. So, $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational.

method 2: Proof by Contradiction:

Assume $\sqrt{p}$ is rational.

Since $p$ is not a perfect square, there exist two coprime positive
integers $m$ and $n$ with $n > 1$ such that $$
\sqrt{p} = \frac{m}{n}
$$

Then $$
p = \frac{m^2}{n^2}
$$

which implies $$
m^2 = n^2 p
$$ i.e. $n^2 \mid m^2$. So $n \mid m^2$

Since $n > 1$, it follows that there exists a prime number $r$ such that
$r \mid n$. (proof using Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:

Every integer greater than 1 is either a prime or can be uniquely
factored into prime numbers.

If $n$ is a prime number, then $r = n$ and clearly $r \mid n$;

If $n$ is not a prime number, it must be decomposable into a product of
prime factors. Therefore, we can write: $$
n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}
$$

where $p_i$ are prime numbers and $e_i$ are positive integers.

Since $n$ is a product of prime factors, at least one of these prime
factors $p_i$ must divide $n$.

Let $r = p_i$, which is one of the prime factors. Then $r \mid n$.

Thus, in both cases, whether $n$ is a prime or not, there exists at
least one prime number $r$ such that $r \mid n$.)

Thus $$
r \mid m^2 \quad \text{and} \quad r \mid m
$$ (proof of $$
r \mid m^2 \quad \text{and} \quad r \mid m
$$: proof1 using prime factorization as method 1's:

$r \mid m^2$ and r is a prime so $r=p_i$ corresponding to the
exponential of $2a_i$

since $a_i \geq 0$, so $a_i$ is at least 1 . proof2 using if r is a
prime and r\|ab, then r\|a or r\|b:

Suppose $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$ (contradiction assumption).

Let $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = d$ (where $d$ is the greatest common divisor
of $a \cdot b$ and $r$).

Since $d \mid r$, $d$ is a divisor of $r$ (since $r$ is a prime number).

Therefore, $d$ is either $r$ or $1$ (since $r$ is prime).

if $d = r$, we have $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = r$. This implies
$r \mid a \cdot b$.

Since we assumed $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$, it contradicts our initial
statement based on Properties of greatest common divisor with its proof
using Bezou's theorem;

If $d = 1$, we have $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = 1$. This implies
$r \nmid a \cdot b$, which contradicts our assumption that
$r \mid a \cdot b$.

Thus, the contradiction shows that our assumption $r \nmid a$ and
$r \nmid b$ must be false. Therefore, $r$ must divide at least one of
$a$ or $b$.

)

Since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, this leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, $\sqrt{p}$ must be an irrational number.
