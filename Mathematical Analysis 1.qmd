## statement

### ---An assertion that is either true of false but not both

e.g. 

#### Negation of a statement p is a statement which means the opposite of P

~p----read "not p"


#### Quantifiers 
all, every, each,no(none)---universal quantifiers


some,there exists, there is at least on, etc.---existential quantifiers




P: *some* a's are b's


~P: *all* a's are not b's/ no a's are b's 


P: *some* a are not b


~p: *all* a are b


#### Truth table: give the truth values of related statements in all possible cases
(relevant to boolean in computer science)

```python
# Example of boolean logic in a program
is_raining = True
has_umbrella = False

if is_raining and not has_umbrella:
    print("You need an umbrella!")
else:
    print("You're good to go!")

```

compound statement: combining several statements via logical operations

Conjunction: p^q. p and q

Disjunction:
p v q--p or q 


one of them is true, p v q is true, so we only need to decide if oe of them is true, if it is, the p v q is true


p V (~p) is always true


a statement that is always true is called a tautology




## P10,1.4
Equivalence of statements: Two statements are **logically equivalent**, if they have the same truth values in all possible situations.

$A\equiv B$

'abstract non-sense'



**Them(De Morgan's laws)**

$\sim (A \lor B) \equiv (\sim A) \land (\sim B)$

交的话（and），都T才T；并的话（or），1T则T


**Conditional:**

If p(hypothesis/assumption/condition), then q(conclusion/consequence/result).


read: p implies q/assume p, then q.

key point: the implication is False when the rule is broken

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
A & B & A \rightarrow B \\
\hline
T & T & T \\
T & F & F \\
F & T & T \\
F & F & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$
**Def:** p, q,p-->q

1)Converce: q--->p,i.e. if q, then p

2)Contrapositive: (~q)-->(~p), i.e. if not q, then not p

**Prop:** (p-->q)$\equiv$ ((~q)-->(~p))
$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
p & q & \sim p & \sim q & p \rightarrow q & \sim q \rightarrow \sim p & (p \rightarrow q) \equiv (\sim q \rightarrow \sim p) \\
\hline
T & T & F & F & T & T & T \\
T & F & F & T & F & F & T \\
F & T & T & F & T & T & T \\
F & F & T & T & T & T & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

**Proof by contradiction**: we want to prove p--->q, we prove (~q)---->(~p) instead

proof: Assume ~q,
       if , then
       if , then
       ...
       --> ~p, which is contradict to the original assumption p
       
       Hence the assumption ~q is false, i.e. q is true.#
       

e.g.: n is a natural number. Prove that if n^2 is divisible by 2(p), then n is divisible by 2(q).


Proof: Assume that n is not divisible by 2(~q),---> n is odd(defination), i.e. n =2k+1,k$\in Z$


---> n^2 =(2k+1)^2(multiplicaiton)=2()+1, which is odd


---> n^2 is not divisible by 2(~p),

Thus the aassumption that n is not divisible by 2 is false so n is divisible by 2.#


**biconditional:** p,q,

(p-->q)$\land$(q--->p)

statement      converse
$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
p & q & p \rightarrow q & q \rightarrow p & p \leftrightarrow q \\
\hline
T & T & T & T & T \\
T & F & F & T & F \\
F & T & T & F & F \\
F & F & T & T & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$


Them: the only case p<-->q is true is then both p and q ture or false

对于这个，我们的逻辑是根据内容判断谁implies谁，然后把它带入truth table，对吗？eg

### an eg question-Logical Puzzle on Truth of Statements relavent to truth table

Consider the following 99 statements:

- $S_1$: "Among these 99 statements, there is at most one true statement."
- $S_2$: "Among these 99 statements, there are at most two true statements."
- ...
- $S_{99}$: "Among these 99 statements, there are at most 99 true statements."

The goal is to determine which statements among these 99 are true.

(hint:Consider the chain of implications from statement $S_n$ to $S_{n+1}$. Which statement implies which?
)

sol:
If $S_n$ is true, it logically implies that $S_{n+1}$ must also be true because if there are at most $n$ true statements, then it is also true that there are at most $n+1$ true statements.
(we also could use truth table to explain it:
$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
S_{n+1} & S_n & S_{n+1} \Rightarrow S_n \\
\hline
T & T & T \\
T & F & F \\
F & T & T \\
F & F & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

so we fail the hypothesis of $S_{n+1}\Rightarrow S_n$

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
S_n & S_{n+1} & S_n \Rightarrow S_{n+1} \\
\hline
T & T & T \\
T & F & F \\
F & T & T \\
F & F & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

In this case:
- The second row $(T \Rightarrow F)$ does not exist in our situation.
- The final row $(F \Rightarrow F)$ does not satisfy our assumption about the statements.

Thus, we conclude that the truth of $S_n$ implies the truth of all subsequent statements $S_{n+1}$, which leads us to believe that a chain of implications holds as described earlier in the analysis.


)

$$
S_n \Rightarrow S_{n+1}
$$
so there exists an $S_n$, after which are true while before which are false.


so:There are $100 - n$ true statements.


$$
100 - n \leq n \implies n \geq 50
$$


There are $n - 1$ false statements.
   
$$
n - 1+1\leq 100 - n \implies n \leq 50
$$
so The 50th statement $S_{50}$ is true. Statements $S_1$ to $S_{49}$ are false, and statements $S_{50}$ to $S_{99}$ are true.




# a problem about divisible using greatest common factor to solve(even Bezou's theorem)

Q:"Proof that if a positive integer $p$ is not a perfect square, then $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational."

Sol: Proof by Contradiction:

Assume $\sqrt{p}$ is rational. 

Since $p$ is not a perfect square, there exist two coprime positive integers $m$ and $n$ with $n > 1$ such that
$$
\sqrt{p} = \frac{m}{n}
$$

Then
$$
p = \frac{m^2}{n^2}
$$

which implies
$$
m^2 = n^2 p
$$
i.e. $n^2 \mid m^2$. Then We want to show that $n \mid m$:

Suppose $m^2 = k n^2$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Since $m$ and $n$ are both integers, based on prime factorization, we have:

$$
m = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}
$$

$$
n = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \cdots p_k^{b_k}
$$

where $p_i$ are prime numbers, and $a_i, b_i$ are non-negative integers.

So,

$$
m^2 = p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \cdots p_k^{2a_k}
$$

and

$$
n^2 = p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \cdots p_k^{2b_k}
$$

Since $m^2 = k n^2$, we have:

$$
p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \cdots p_k^{2a_k} = k \cdot p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \cdots p_k^{2b_k}
$$

This implies:

$$
2a_i \geq 2b_i \quad \text{for all } i
$$

So,

$$
a_i \geq b_i \quad \text{for all } i
$$

Thus, $m$ is divisible by $n$. Therefore, $n \mid m$, which is opposite to m and n are coprime. So, $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational.


method 2:
Proof by Contradiction:

Assume $\sqrt{p}$ is rational. 

Since $p$ is not a perfect square, there exist two coprime positive integers $m$ and $n$ with $n > 1$ such that
$$
\sqrt{p} = \frac{m}{n}
$$

Then
$$
p = \frac{m^2}{n^2}
$$

which implies
$$
m^2 = n^2 p
$$
i.e. $n^2 \mid m^2$. So  $n \mid m^2$


Since $n > 1$, it follows that there exists a prime number $r$ such that $r \mid n$.
(proof using Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:

Every integer greater than 1 is either a prime or can be uniquely factored into prime numbers.



If $n$ is a prime number, then $r = n$ and clearly $r \mid n$;


If $n$ is not a prime number, it must be decomposable into a product of prime factors. Therefore, we can write:
$$
n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}
$$

where $p_i$ are prime numbers and $e_i$ are positive integers.

Since $n$ is a product of prime factors, at least one of these prime factors $p_i$ must divide $n$.

Let $r = p_i$, which is one of the prime factors. Then $r \mid n$.

Thus, in both cases, whether $n$ is a prime or not, there exists at least one prime number $r$ such that $r \mid n$.)

Thus
$$
r \mid m^2 \quad \text{and} \quad r \mid m
$$
(proof of $$
r \mid m^2 \quad \text{and} \quad r \mid m
$$:
proof1 using prime factorization as method 1's:


$r \mid m^2$ and r is a prime so $r=p_i$ corresponding to the exponential of $2a_i$



since $a_i \geq 0$, so $a_i$ is at least 1 .
proof2 using if r is a prime and r|ab, then r|a or r|b:

Suppose $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$ (contradiction assumption).

Let $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = d$ (where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $a \cdot b$ and $r$).

Since $d \mid r$, $d$ is a divisor of $r$ (since $r$ is a prime number).

Therefore, $d$ is either $r$ or $1$ (since $r$ is prime).




if $d = r$, we have $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = r$. This implies $r \mid a \cdot b$. 

Since we assumed $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$, it contradicts our initial statement based on Properties of greatest common divisor with its proof using Bezou's theorem;


If $d = 1$, we have $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = 1$. This implies $r \nmid a \cdot b$, which contradicts our assumption that $r \mid a \cdot b$.

Thus, the contradiction shows that our assumption $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$ must be false. Therefore, $r$ must divide at least one of $a$ or $b$.

)

Since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, this leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, $\sqrt{p}$ must be an irrational number.
