## While the dream of becoming a pure mathematician has faded, my pursuit of Mathematical Analysis remains strong, driven by a desire to express my thoughts with precision and elegance. My ultimate aspiration of Analysis is to present ideas that captivate others, compelling them to listen. This is not just about sharing information; it's about conveying logical insights that have been distilled through my own deep engagement with the material, reflecting a genuine and personal comprehension of the subject matter.

## If a question is not trivial, we should know where is the difficulty of it

Here the difficulty is uncountable

eg. f is a continuous function on \[0,1\] $\int_0^1 f(x) x^n dx =0$,
prove that f(x)=0 for all x in \[0,1\].

we have $\int_0^1 f(x) [a_nx^n+...+ax+a_0]dx=0$

We have $\int_0^1 |f(x)|^2 dx=0$ (Weierstrass Approximation Theorem and
Since \$ \|f(x)\|\^2\$ is not negative, Suppose f(x) is not equal to 0,
then we could find a point x0 where f(x0) is not equal to 0, then we
could find a small interval around x0 where f(x) is not equal to 0, then
this interval's integral could not be =0, which is a contradiction (the
meaning of "continuity" is that if a point is greater than 0, then there
is a neighborhood of this point where the function is greater than 0.))

We have $|f|^2=0$ a.e. $x\in [0,1]$

So $f(x)=0$ a.e. $x\in [0,1]$

uncountable is the difficulty of this question (density argument : The
closure of Q is R means that $\forall x \in R$ $\exists x_n \in Q$ such
that $x_n$ converges to x)

So we use the proof by contradiction:

## epislon-delta language is not important, the most important thing is to understand the essence of the proof and the logic behind it. It is better to see everything intuitively.

### eg. The sum of continuous functions

-   2 functions

-   n functions

-   infinite functions ---not continuous! --We could not choose the
    minimum $\delta$ to make the sum continuous.

# Now the content follows the time, not summary at all..

# Understand intuitively (Never memorize anything in math!)

## easy to think wrongly


If $f'(x)$ exists, $(f^2)'$= $2f(x)f'(x)$ but the counter direction might not be true

- eg. If $f^2$ is differentialble and $f^2 > 0$, then |f| is differentiable since we could write |f| as some function of f(x) and
    $f^2$ is differentiable. So we could use the chain rule to show that
    |f| is differentiable. eg. $|f|=e^{1/2lnf^2}$ or just $|f|=\sqrt {f^2}$

- eg. If $f^2$ is differentiable, and $f^2 > 0$ $f$ may not differentiable since f itself may NOT continuous at any $x\in \mathbb{R}$. f(x) is 1 when x is rational and -1 when x is irrational. f(x) is not continuous at any point in $\mathbb{R}$, so f(x) is not differentiable at any point in $\mathbb{R}$.






## Integrability

When we consider a continuous functon's integrability on [a,b], we could divide the function into 2 parts---one is good and the other is bad. For the good part, the uniform continuity guarantes the integrability. For the bad part, we could use the property of boundedness to show that the integral is finite using very thin intervals to cover the bad part. So we could use the property of boundedness to show that the integral is finite using very thin intervals to cover the bad part. 




# Write logically

### Each global expression should just appear once. When it has been introduced, we can regard it as a fixed thing and expand our proof behind logically.

### eg

-   Suppose $f$ is differentiable in
    $(c - \delta, c + \delta) \setminus \{c\}$ for some $\delta > 0$
    with $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f'(x) = A$ exists, and $f$ is continuous
    at $c$. Show that $f'(c)$ exists and $f'(c) = A$ in the following
    two ways:

    -   By applying Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem.

    -   By applying L'Hospital's Rule.

! Explain clearly how continuity of $f$ at $c$ is used in your argument
in each case.

-   proof:

    Let ε \> 0. Since $lim_ {x→c} f'(x) = A$ there exists δ \> 0 such
    that ∀x ∈ (c - δ', c + δ')  {c}, \|f'(x) - A\| \< ε (\*) .

    Now, take x ∈ (c - δ', c + δ')  {c}.

    We have that f is continuous on the closed interval between x and c
    and differentiable on the open interval between x and c.

    So by Lagrange's MVT we have ∃ξ between x and c s.t.

    (f(x) - f(c)) / (x - c) = f'(ξ)

    Hence, we have that

    \|(f(x) - f(c)) / (x - c) - A\| \< ε by (\*) because \|f'(ξ) - A\|
    \< ε.

    Hence $lim_{x→c} (f(x) - f(c)) / (x - c) = A.$

    i.e. f'(c) = A

## All ways to distinguish whether it is uniformly continuous

please fill this before your final exam!

### practice before my mid-term exam (my way to think that of question is like this)

$f(x) = x^4$ is not uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.

Choose $x_n = \sqrt[4]{n+1}$, $y_n = \sqrt[4]{n}$.

Since $x^{1/4}$ is differentiable on $[n, n+1]$, by Lagrange's MVT,

$$|x_n - y_n| = \frac{1}{4} \xi^{-\frac{3}{4}} (n+1-n), \text{ where } \xi \in (n, n+1)$$

So
$|x_n - y_n| = \frac{1}{4} \xi^{-\frac{3}{4}} < \frac{1}{4} n^{-\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{1}{4 \sqrt[4]{n^3}}$

So $0 < |x_n - y_n| < \frac{1}{4 \sqrt[4]{n^3}}$

So $\lim_{n \to \infty} |x_n - y_n| = 0$ by squeeze theorem

So for $\varepsilon_0 = \frac{1}{2}$, by the definition of
limit，$\forall \delta > 0$, $\exists m > 0$ s.t. for
$n_0\in \mathbb{N} > m$, $|x_{n_0} - y_{n_0}| < \delta$ but
$|f(x_{n_0}) - f(y_{n_0})| = 1 > \varepsilon_0 = \frac{1}{2}$,

This satisfies the negation of the definition of "uniformly continuous".

# Preface

The first section here is the knowledge that attracts most of my
interests on this module, followed by the lecture notes I tapped when I
am on the journey of this module.

### The begining main idea of Analysis about the establishment of real number

### Motivation

f(x)+f(y)=f(x+y) (addition in linearity in linear transformation)

(a line across the original point)

-   1--\>1+1--\>1+1+1---\>n positive integer(addition is needed/1 is
    needed)

-   0---\>0-1---0-1-1----n positive integer(addition is needed/0 is
    needed)

-   $\frac{p}{q}$---- rational number(multiplication is needed)

Since the rational number is countable(\|N\|=\|N$\times$N\|=\|Q\|) but
irrational number is uncountable, we could not directly go ahead from Q
to R\\Q. Fortunately, we have the property of density of irrational
number(of course also rational number) in R. In this case we could
introduce *limit* here, and also **continuity**

-   This means that, usually, if a situation in rational number is true,
    then in the whole real number it is almost true.

-   Finally we get a whole line across the original point here.

#### Example1

If f(x) is continuous on R. g(x)=f(x) when x is a rational number. Then
we have g(x)=f(x) on R.

##### Proof

Use sequence to think intuitively and write down the proof rigorously:

Without loss of generalization, here we let our R-continuous function to
be $x^2$.

question: If f is continuous on \[a,b\], f(x)=$x^2$ if x $\in$ R\\Q.
Show: f(x)=\$x\^2, \forall x\in R \$ in \[a,b\]

proof:

Firstly we write down **Sequential criterion of limit** which we will
use to finish the proof:

(Sequential criterion for limits of functions). Let
$f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The following are equivalent. 1.
$\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=\ell$. 2. For any sequence
$\left(a_n\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $a_n \in A, a_n \neq a$ and
$\lim _n a_n=a$, we have $$
\lim _n f\left(a_n\right)=\ell
$$

Proof. (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2): Suppose
$\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=\ell$. Then
$\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists \delta>0$ such that $\forall x$ with
$|x-a|<\delta$ and $x \neq a$, we have $$
|f(x)-\ell|<\varepsilon
$$

Let $\lim _n a_n=a, a_n \in A$ and $a_n \neq a$ for all
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then for the $\delta>0$ above corresponding to
$\varepsilon, \exists k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$\forall n \geq k, n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $$
\left|a_n-a\right|<\delta
$$ which implies $$
\left|f\left(a_n\right)-\ell\right|<\varepsilon .
$$

That shows that $\lim _n f\left(a_n\right)=\ell$. $(2) \Rightarrow(1)$ :
Suppose for the sake of contradiction that
$\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x) \neq \ell$. Then $\exists \varepsilon_0>0$
such that $\forall \delta>0, \exists x$ with $|x-a|<\delta$ and
$x \neq a$ such that $$
|f(x)-\ell| \geq \varepsilon_0
$$

We construct a sequence as follows. Take $\delta=\frac{1}{n}$. Then
$\exists a_n$ with $\left|a_n-a\right|<\delta=\frac{1}{n}$ and
$a_n \neq a$ such that
$\left|f\left(a_n\right)-\ell\right| \geq \varepsilon_0 . a_n$ satisfies
$$
a-\frac{1}{n}<a_n<a+\frac{1}{n} .
$$

By letting $n \rightarrow+\infty$ and using the Squeeze Theorem(or we
could use another method to finish argument here by constructing only
one sequence (choose $\delta$ to be $1/n$ also and then always find one
$x_n$ in the $\delta-$ neighborhood and this $x_n$ is also convergent to
a)), we have $\lim _n a_n=a$. So by the given condition,
$\lim _n f\left(a_n\right)=\ell$. However, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
$$
\left|f\left(a_n\right)-\ell\right| \geq \varepsilon_0 \Rightarrow f\left(a_n\right) \geq \ell+\varepsilon_0 \text { or } f\left(a_n\right) \leq \ell-\varepsilon_0 .
$$ contradicting to f$(a_n)$ is convergent.

Now we begin our proof:

We have known that if $a_n\in$ R/Q f(a$_n$)=${a_n}^2$

Since we have the property of "irrational numbers are dense on R" we
know that $\exists a_n\in(a-1/n,a+1/n), \forall n\in N, a\in Q$. This
constructs our sequence $a_n$ such that
$lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} a_n=a, a\in Q$

This implies that
$lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(a_n)=f(lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_n)$=f(a).

(The first equality is because of this proposition:(Limit of composition
of functions). Let
$f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, g: B \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that
$R(f) \subseteq B$. If $\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=\ell$ and $g(x)$ is
continuous at $\ell$, i.e. $\lim _{x \rightarrow \ell} g(x)=g(\ell)$,
then $$
\lim _{x \rightarrow a} g(f(x))=g(\ell)=g\left(\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)\right) .
$$ proof:Proof. $\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists \delta>0$ such that
$\forall y$ with $|y-\ell|<\delta$ and $y \in B$, we have $$
|g(y)-g(\ell)|<\varepsilon
$$

For this $\delta, \exists \delta^{\prime}>0$ such that $\forall x$ with
$0<|x-a|<\delta^{\prime}$ and $x \in A$, we have $$
|f(x)-\ell|<\delta
$$

So if $0<|x-a|<\delta^{\prime}$ and $x \in A$, then $|f(x)-\ell|<\delta$
and $f(x) \in B$, which imply that $|g(f(x))-g(\ell)|<\varepsilon$. This
proves the proposition. )

Also,
$lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}f(a_n)=lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}{a_n}^2$=$(lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}{a_n})^2=a^2$

So we have f(a)=$a^2$.

# max and min need to be found

the minimum $\epsilon$

# open set is like interval

## Theorem

Let $O\subset R$ be an open set then $O=\cup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ where
$I_n$ is an open interval in R

## Def

A collection of open sets covers a set A if $A\subset \cup O_\alpha$.
The collection {$O_\alpha$} is called an open cover of A.

## Theorem

Let C={$O_\alpha$} be a collection of open sets of real numbers then
there is a countable subcollection {$O_i$} of C such that
$\cup_{O\in C}O=\cup_{n=1}^\infty O_i$

Any open cover of a set of real numbers contains a countable subcover.

## if a not empty set has upper bound, then it must have the unique sup.

**Prove: if a not empty set has upper bound, then it must have the
unique sup.**

### Method 1: (Completeness axiom)

$$
\begin{gathered}
X \neq \phi, \quad Y=\{y \in \mathbb{R} \mid \forall x \in X(x \leq y)\} \neq \phi \\
\\
\forall x \in X, \forall y \in Y, x \leq y \\
\\
\Rightarrow \exists c \in \mathbb R, \forall x \in X, \forall y \in Y, \\
\\
x \leqslant c \leqslant y(\text { Completeness axiom) } \\
\\
\Rightarrow(c \in Y) \wedge(\{\forall y \in Y \mid y \geqslant c\}) \\
\\
\Rightarrow c=\min Y
\end{gathered}
$$

So $c$ is the only sup. (uniqueness of minimum element of a set---2
inequalities lead to the equality leading to the only one result).

### Method 2: Cantor Nested Interval Property(limit思想).asdfaskfkasdjklsad

We choose a random upper bound $\gamma, x \in E($ the set) $$
[x, r]=\left[a_1 b_1\right] \supset\left[a_2, b_2\right] \supset \cdots \left[a_n, b_n\right]
$$ (each time we use the method of bisection to choose one side
Including the point in $E$ ) \$\$

```{=tex}
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Since }\left[a_1, b_1\right] \supset\left[a_2, b_2\right] \cdots, b_n-a_n=\frac{\gamma-x}{2^{n-1}} \rightarrow 0, \\
& \beta \in\left[a_n, b_n\right],(n=1,2, \cdots), \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} b_n=\beta \text {(limit thinking of the Cantor Nested Interval) } \\
& \Rightarrow \forall c \in E, c \leqslant b_n \Rightarrow c \leqslant \beta \text { (E }  \text {is never on the right of} [a_n,b_n]) \\
& \Rightarrow \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists d \in E, d>\beta-\varepsilon\text { (each} [a_n,b_n] \text { has points in E.(or see the attached picture to see more picisely))}
\end{aligned}
```
![](images/clipboard-1103791551.png)

## If a not empty set has lower bound, then it must have the unique inf.

### Method 1: same as before.

### Method 2: Based on before.

Suppose We choose $m$ as a lower bound of $E$. $$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \forall x \in E, x \geqslant m,-x \leqslant-m \text {. } \\
& \text { Let } F=\{-x \mid x \in E\} \text {. } \\
& \Rightarrow \beta=\sup F \\
& \Rightarrow-x \leqslant \beta, x \geqslant-\beta \text {. } \\
& \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists-d \in E,-d>\beta-\varepsilon, \\
& \Rightarrow d<-\beta+\varepsilon \\
& \Rightarrow-\beta=\inf E
\end{aligned}
$$ $$
\Rightarrow-\sup (-E)=\operatorname{inf} E \text {. }
$$

### Method 3 more generalized than Method 2's conclusion (if c is negative then inf(cA)=csupA)

In fact, If $c<0$, then
$\sup (cA)=\operatorname{cinf} A, \inf (c A)=\operatorname{csup} A$.
(and **in particular. sup** $(-B)=-$ inf $B$ )

Since if M=supA, $\forall x\in A,x\leq M,cx\geq cM$, which indicates
that cM is the lower bound of cX.

So, $cA$ has lower bound ( $s$ )if and only if $A$ has upper
bound(s).(inverse, also true) $cA$ is not empty if and only if A is not
empty.

So, cA has $\inf (cA)$ if and only if $A$ has supA $$
\begin{aligned}
& \forall c x \in C A, c x \geqslant c M \\
& \text { if } \exists c M', \forall c x \in c A, c x \geqslant c M^{\prime}, c M^{\prime}>c M, \\
& X \leq M^{\prime}, M^{\prime}<M(\forall x \in A)
\end{aligned}
$$

Contradicting to the condition that $M=\sup A$

So $\nexists C M^{\prime}$ So cM is the largest lower bound $$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { so } c M=\inf (c A) \\
& \text { so } c\sup A=\inf (c A)
\end{aligned}
$$

## exercise: (1,2\]'s sup--

### Method 1

-   2 is an upper bound of \[1,2) (obviously)
-   if $\exists \varepsilon>0$, s.t $2-\varepsilon$ is also an upper
    bound of $[1,2)$ $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & \because 1 \in[1,2) \\
    & \therefore2-\varepsilon \geqslant 1
    \end{aligned}
    $$ choose $2-\frac{\varepsilon}{2} \in(2-\varepsilon, 2)$ Then
    $2-\frac{\varepsilon}{2} \in[1,2)$ So
    $\exists\left(2-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right) \in[1,2)$ while
    $\left(2-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)>(2-\varepsilon)$ So
    $2-\varepsilon$ is not an upper bound, contradicting to the suppose.
    So we have proved that 2 is the smallest upper bound, i.e.
    $\sup [1,2)=2$.

### Method 2

-   2 is an upper bound of \[1,2) (obviously)
-   $\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists b \in[1,2)$ with $b>2-\varepsilon$.
    We can take $b=\max \left\{2-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}, 1\right\}$.

## exercise: supC=sup(A+B)=supA+supB from Professor A Kun

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\text { if } A\subset R,  B\subset R, \text { define: } \\
C  :=A+B=\{z \in R: z=x+y, x \in A, y \in B\} \\
D  :=A-B=\{z \in R: z=x-y, x \in A, y \in B\}
\end{array}
$$ show that $$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { (1) } \sup C=\sup (A+B)=\sup A+\sup B \\
& \text { (2) } \sup D=\sup (A-B)=\sup A-\inf B
\end{aligned}
$$ (1) Proof:: Obviously,$C$ has upper bounds if and only if $A$ and $B$
have upper bounds, and $C$ is not empty. So $C$ has sup C if and only if
and only if $A$ has sup $A$ and $B$ has sup $B$. (Completeness axiom).

-   prove: $\sup C \leqslant \sin A+\sup B$. $$
    \because x+y \leqslant \sup A+\sup  B
    $$ $\therefore(\operatorname{sip} A+\sup B)$ is an upper bound of
    $C$ $$
    \therefore \sin C \leqslant \sin A+\sup B
    $$
-   Prove : $\sup C \geqslant \operatorname{supA}+$ sup B $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & \because \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists x \in A, y \in B \text {, s.t. } \\
    & \operatorname{sup} A-\varepsilon<x, \operatorname{sup} B-\varepsilon<y . \\
    & \Rightarrow \sup A+\sup B-2 \varepsilon<x+y \\
    & \text { i.e. }(\operatorname{sup} A+\sup B-2 \varepsilon)_{\text {max }}<(x+y)_{\text {max }}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Since $x+y \leq$ sup c We have
$\sup A+\sup B-2 \varepsilon<\sup c, \forall \varepsilon>0$ $$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { i.e. } \operatorname{(sup} A+\sup B-2 \varepsilon)_{\text {max }}<\sup C \\
\end{aligned}
$$

We. As $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, We have
$\operatorname{sup} A+\sup B \leqslant \operatorname{} \operatorname{sup} C$
So, we have
$\operatorname{Sup} C=\operatorname{Sup} A+\operatorname{Sup} B$. Then,
we have $\sup D=\sup (A-B)$ $$
\begin{aligned}
& =\sup (A+(-B)) \\
& =\sup A+\sup (-B) \\
& =\sup A-\inf B
\end{aligned}
$$ (We have proved $\sup (-B)=-\inf B$ before)

### another example

```         
 Let M ∈ R and A, B be two bounded, negative subsets of R,0 < x, y < M, ∀x ∈ A, y ∈ B
when we are proving sup C = sup(AB) = sup A · sup B
On the other hand, from the definition of $a^*$ and $b^*, \forall \epsilon>0$ there exist $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ such that
```

$$
a^*-\epsilon<a<a^* \quad \text { and } \quad b^*-\epsilon<b<b^*
$$

Then $$
\left(a^*-\epsilon\right)\left(b^*-\epsilon\right)<a b \leqslant a^* b^*
$$ or ignoring $\epsilon^2$ term (If ε \> 0, then ε, 3ε, ε², ε⁵, they
all represent "any number greater than zero", and ε' also represents any
number greater than zero, so they are equivalent, that is, we can say
that they are equal to ε'.) $$
a^* b^*-(a+b) \epsilon=a^* b^*-\epsilon^{\prime}<a b \leq c^*
$$

This is true for all $\epsilon^{\prime}>0$, so $$
\sup A \sup B=a^* b^* \leq c^*=\sup C
$$

Combining the above two inequalities, we can conclude that
$\sup A \sup B=$ $\sup C$. \## an exercise about think good Archimedean
number from Professor Andrew Lin(A Kun)

13. Consider the set $$
    A=\left\{\left.(-1)^n\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right) \right\rvert\, n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\right\} .
    $$

-   Show that 1 is an upper bound for $A$.
-   Show that if $d$ is an upper bound for $A$, then $d \geq 1$.
-   Use (a) and (b) to show that $\sup A=1$. \[Solution\]:
-   We will show that for any $x \in A, x \leq 1$. Since $x \in A$, then
    $x=(-1)^n(1-$ $1 / n$ ) for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Since
    $\frac{1}{n}>0$, then $1-\frac{1}{n}<1$. We argue our desired
    inequality in two cases. If $n$ is even, then
    $x=(-1)^n(1-1 / n)=1-1 / n<1$. If $n$ is odd, then
    $x=(-1)^n(1-1 / n)=-1+1 / n<0<1$. In either case, $x \leq 1$ (in
    fact, $x<1$ ) and 1 is an upper bound for $A$.
-   Let $d$ be an upper bound for $A$. Thus, $(-1)^n(1-1 / n) \leq d$
    for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Assume, to the contrary that $d<1$.
    Thus, $1-d>0$. By the Archimedean Property, there exists an
    $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$such that $1<(1-d) n$. Since $n>0$, we can
    rewrite this as $\frac{1}{n}<1-d$, which is equivalent to
    $d<1-\frac{1}{n}$. If $n$ is even, then $(-1)^n=1$ and we have that
    $$
    d<(-1)^n\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right) \in A
    $$ contradicting the fact that $d$ is an upper bound. If $n$ is odd,
    then consider instead $n+1$, which is even. Then, $(-1)^{n+1}=1$ and
    $$
    d<1-\frac{1}{n}<(-1)^{n+1}\left(1-\frac{1}{n+1}\right) \in A
    $$

This again contradicts that $d$ is an upper bound for $A$. Either way,
we reach a contradiction and therefore conclude that $d \geq 1$.

lower bound + inequaility ---smallest upper bound---sup

## another exercise about another episilon from Professor A Kun

14. Find the least upper bound for the following set and $$
    A=\left\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \cdots, \frac{n}{n+1}, \cdots\right\}
    $$ \[Solution\]: We note that every element of $A$ is less than 1
    since $$
    \frac{n}{n+1}<1, \quad n=1,2,3, \cdots
    $$

We claim that the least upper bound is $1, \sup A=1$. Assume that 1 is
not the least upper bound. Then there is an $\epsilon>0$ such that
$1-\epsilon$ is also an upper bound. However, we claim that there is a
natural number $n$ such that $$
1-\epsilon<\frac{n}{n+1}
$$

This inequality is equivalent to the following sequence of inequalities
$$
1-\frac{n}{n+1}<\epsilon \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \frac{1}{\epsilon}-1<n
$$

Reversing the above sequence of inequalities shows that if
$n>\frac{1}{\epsilon}-1$, then $1-\epsilon<\frac{n}{n+1}$ showing that
$1-\epsilon$ is not an upper bound for $A$.

(if n \> 1/ $\epsilon$-1, $\nexists \epsilon$ s.t. 1-$\epsilon$ is an
upper bound, contradicting to our suppose)

This verifies our answer.

## Prove Cantor Nested Interval Property

**Prove:**

-   $\exists c \in$ all closed internals

    -   i.e. if the non-empty closed intervals
        $I_1 \supset I_2 \supset I_3 \cdots, \exists c \in R$, s.t.
        $c\in I_i, \forall i \in \mathbb{N}$, $c \in$
        $\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} I_i$

-   If the limit of the lengths of these intervals are 0 then the point
    is unique

    -   i.e. if$\left|I_n\right| \rightarrow 0$, c is unique

$$
\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists I_n(|I_n| < \varepsilon) \Rightarrow c \text { ! }
$$

**Proof**:

-   proof of 1

$I_1=[a_1, b_1]$

claim $\forall I_n=[a_n, b_n], I_m=[a_m, b_m]$ i.e. $a_n \leq b_m$

(if $a_n>b_m$, then $a_m \leq b_m<a_n<b_n$, which means they are
separate internals without any intersection.) $$
\begin{aligned}
&\text { Let } X=\left\{a_n\right\} (\text { left endpoint set) } \\
&\text { Let } Y=\left\{b_m\right\}(\text { right endpoint set) } \\
& \forall a_n \in X, \forall b_m \in Y, a_n \leq c\leq b_m
\end{aligned}
$$ $\Rightarrow \exists c \in \mathbb{R}$, s.t., $\forall a_n \in X$
$\forall b_m \in Y,a_n\leqslant b_m$.(completeness axiom) We then let
$m=n \Rightarrow c \in I_n$

-   proof of 2

**Based on “Any implication is equivalent to its contrapositive”**

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { if } \exists c_1<c_2, \text { s.t. } c_1, c_2 \in I_n, \\
& \forall n \in \mathbb{R}, a_n \leqslant c_1<c_2 \leqslant b_n, \\
& \Rightarrow\left|I_n\right|=b_n-a_n \geqslant c_2-c_1
\end{aligned}
$$

We then choose $\varepsilon=\frac{c_2-c_1}{2}>0$

then there exists no $I_n$ s.t. $\left|I_n\right|<\varepsilon$, since

$|I_n|\geqslant c_2-c_1 \geqslant \frac{c_2-c_1}{2}$

So if $\exists I_n s. t .\left|I_n\right|<\varepsilon$, $c!$

## prove finite covering lemma

**Prove：Finite Covering Lemma** $$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Def: } S:=\{X\}, \text { ( } x \text { is a set) } \\
Y \subset \bigcup_{X \in S} X
\end{gathered}
$$

We say. $S$ is a cover of $Y$. $$
\text { i.e. } \forall y \in Y, \exists X \in S,(y \in X)
$$

Finite Covering Lemma:

If $I:[a, b]$, $$
I \subset \bigcup_{n \in I} U_n, U_n=\left(\alpha_n, \beta_n\right)
$$ $\exists U_1, \cdots U_k$, s.t., $I\subset \bigcup_{i=1}^k U_i$

**（Summray of Finite Covering Lemma: A closed internal can be covered
by finite number of open internals）**

**proof:**

suppose $I=[a, b]$ could not be coverd by finite number open intervals:

Then we use the method of bisection to separate I,s.t.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& I=I_1 \supset I_2 \supset I_3 \cdots I_n \supset \cdots \text { ( all In can not be covered } \\
& \left|I_n\right|=\frac{b-a}{2^n} \rightarrow 0 \\
& \text { Gover) } \\
& \Rightarrow \exists: C \in \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} I_i \text { (Cantor Nested Interral Property) } \\
& c_i\in[a_i,b_i]\\
& \Rightarrow C\in I\subset \bigcup U_i\text {(based on the given condition of the proof problem)}\\
& \Rightarrow \exists U=[\alpha,\beta],s.t.c\in U，let ：\varepsilon =min[c-\alpha,\beta-c]\\
& \Rightarrow I_n\subset U
\end{aligned}
$$

![](images/clipboard-4085119236.png)

which indicates that at least this $I_n$ is covered by U, contradicting
to the suppose.

so the finite covering lemma is true.

## Countability and Bijections

Countable Set: A set is said to be countable if it is either finite or
has the same size (cardinality) as the set of natural numbers
$\mathbb{N}$. A set is countably infinite if there exists a bijection (a
one-to-one correspondence) between that set and $\mathbb{N}$.

Uncountable Set: A set is uncountable if no such bijection exists,
meaning its cardinality is strictly greater than that of $\mathbb{N}$.

Bijection: A bijection between two sets $A$ and $B$ is a function
$f: A \to B$ that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

### The Problem: Showing that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is Uncountable

![](images/clipboard-3258860968.png)

method 1: Consider the set
$A = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n \notin f(n) \}$, f : N → P(N).

we should prove it is not a bijection. so we could prove it is not
surjective (P(N) is much bigger than N).

now we ask if f is surjective:

If yes, there exists $n_0\in N$ s.t. f$(n_0)=$A, A$\subset$N while A
$\in$ P(N)

now we ask: Does $n_o\in f(n_0)$

1)  if yes, $n_0\notin A=f(n_0)$

2)  if no, $n_0\in A=f(n_0)$

(or we discuss the set, we suppose x is in A and based on the condition
of being in set A we get A is empty, which is contradicts to "x is in
A")

so f is not surjective, which means f could not be bijective. so p(N) is
uncountable.

### an eg question-Logical Puzzle on Truth of Statements relavent to truth table

Consider the following 99 statements:

-   $S_1$: "Among these 99 statements, there is at most one true
    statement."
-   $S_2$: "Among these 99 statements, there are at most two true
    statements."
-   ...
-   $S_{99}$: "Among these 99 statements, there are at most 99 true
    statements."

The goal is to determine which statements among these 99 are true.

(hint:Consider the chain of implications from statement $S_n$ to
$S_{n+1}$. Which statement implies which? )

sol: we fail the hypothesis of $S_{n+1}\Rightarrow S_n$，but because

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
S_n & S_{n+1} & S_n \Rightarrow S_{n+1} \\
\hline
T & T & T \\
T & F & F \\
F & T & T \\
F & F & T \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Thus, we conclude that the truth of $S_n$ implies the truth of all
subsequent statements $S_{n+1}$.

)

$$
S_n \Rightarrow S_{n+1}
$$ so there exists an $S_n$, after which are true while before which are
false.

so:There are $100 - n$ true statements.

$$
100 - n \leq n \implies n \geq 50
$$

There are $n - 1$ false statements.

$$
n - 1+1\leq 100 - n \implies n \leq 50
$$ so The 50th statement $S_{50}$ is true. Statements $S_1$ to $S_{49}$
are false, and statements $S_{50}$ to $S_{99}$ are true.

## Cardinality

-   numebr of elements in a finite set: Def: let A be a set, if A
    contains finitely many elements, then the number of elements of A is
    called the cardinality of A, denoted by \|A\|(\|A\|$\in Z_{\geq0}$

-   A, B have infinitely many elements. If $\exists f:A->B$ is a
    bijective map, then we regard the A, B have the same "cardinality",
    i.e.\|A\|=\|B\|

## A x B--Cartesian product

### eg

\|A\|=3, \|B\|=2, \|A x B\|=6

## map

Question from the Cardinality:

What happens if A has infinitely many elements?

Def: LEt A and B be 2 sets, A map(function)f: A--\>B assigns each
element in A

there has 3 kinds of maps(see 107)

### eg

the graph of f(x) in A x B is f: A--\> B(x $\in A$,y$\in B$)

## inverse defination

if f is a bijective map, so as $f^{-1}$.

## countable

-   A set A is called countable if A iseither a finite set of there
    exists a bijective map f: A to N.(Otherwise is uncountable)

### eg

-   $B=[x|x=2n,n\in N$ is countable

proof: for x\|--\>x/2 of B--\>N i) injective , \$\forall x_1 \$ not =
$x_2$, f(x_1)=x/2, = f(x_2)

```         
   ii) surjective, $\forall y\in N $, $\exists x\in B$ s.t. ,f(2y)=x, $2y\in B$
   
   so bijective
   
```

-   Z is countable (负无穷到正无穷范围内的整数)

f:N--\>Z(n\|--\>n/2 if even, 1-n/2 if odd)

n\|--\>n/2 if even makes the positive integer possible

1-n/2 if odd makes negative integer possible

and both of them are bijections

so Z is countable

-   $\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=\ell$ if and only if
    $\lim _{x \rightarrow a^{+}} f(x)=\lim _{x \rightarrow a^{-}} f(x)=\ell$.

Necessary Condition Let $f(x) \rightarrow l$ as $x \rightarrow c$.

Then from the definition of the limit of a function: $$
\forall \epsilon>0: \exists \delta>0: 0<|x-c|<\delta \Longrightarrow|f(x)-l|<\epsilon
$$

So for any given $\epsilon$, there exists a $\delta$ such that: $$
0<|x-c|<\delta
$$ implies that: $$
l-\epsilon<f(x)<l+\epsilon
$$

Now: $$
\begin{array}{ll} 
& 0<|x-c|<\delta \\
\leadsto \quad & -\delta<-(x-c)<0 \\
& \vee \quad 0<(x-c)<\delta \\
\leadsto \quad & c-\delta<x<c \\
& \vee \quad c<x<c+\delta
\end{array}
$$

That is: $\forall \epsilon>0: \exists \delta>0$ :

(1): $\quad c-\delta<x<c \Longrightarrow\|f(x)-l\|<\epsilon$

(2) : $\quad c<x<c+\delta \Longrightarrow\|f(x)-l\|<\epsilon$

So given that particular value of $\epsilon$, we can find a value of
$\delta$ such that the conditions for both:

(1): $\quad f$ tending to the limit $l$ as $x$ tends to $c$ from the
left

and :

(2) : $\quad f$ tending to the limit $l$ as $x$ tends to $c$ from the
    right.

Thus: $$
\lim _{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=l
$$ implies that: $$
\lim _{x \rightarrow c^{-}} f(x)=l
$$ and: $$
\lim _{x \rightarrow c^{+}} f(x)=l
$$

Sufficient Condition

Let $f(x) \rightarrow l$ as $x \rightarrow c^{-}$and
$f(x) \rightarrow l$ as $x \rightarrow c^{+}$.

This means that:

(1):
$\forall \epsilon>0: \exists \delta>0: c-\delta<x<c \Longrightarrow|f(x)-l|<\epsilon$

and :

(2):
$\forall \epsilon>0: \exists \delta>0: c<x<c+\delta \Longrightarrow|f(x)-l|<\epsilon$

In the same manner as above, the conditions on $\delta$ give us that: $$
\begin{array}{ll} 
& c-\delta<x<c \\
\wedge \quad & c<x<c+\delta \\
& 0<|x-c|<\delta
\end{array}
$$

So: $$
\forall \epsilon>0: \exists \delta>0: 0<|x-c|<\delta \Longrightarrow|f(x)-l|<\epsilon
$$

Thus: $$
\lim _{x \rightarrow c^{-}} f(x)=l
$$ and: $$
\lim _{x \rightarrow c^{+}} f(x)=l
$$ together imply that: $$
\lim _{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=l
$$

    exists no sequence composed by elements in A convergent to a point
    at \[0,1\]\A so we should think of another way to prove this---If
    b$\in [0,1]\A$, then there is an n_0 such that\$
    1/2(n_0+1)\<b\<1/2n_0,\$ i.e. b$\in (1/2(n_0+1),1/2n_0).$ For any

    such that $a_n\in (1/2(n_0+1),1/2n_0).$ ( It works as the following:
    We take an
    $\epsilon=1/2 min{|1/2(n_0+1)-b|, |1/2n_0-b|}, then there exists an N.0 such that |a_n-b|<\epsilon.$
    ===\> when n\>N,
    a_n$\in(b- \epsilon, b+ \epsilon)\subset (1/2(n_0+1),1/2n_0) )$
    Notice that (1/2(n_0+1),1/2n_0) does not intersect with A. Therefore
    f(a_n)=0. lim_nf(a_n)=0=f(b). Hence f is continuous at b.

     xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
grid()
```

its supremum exists, which is $\pi /2$, however, its limit does not
exist.

Reason: for sup we only need one "existence of $x_0$" since it says
$\forall n \in N$ $\exists x_0 \in R$ s.t. $M < f(x_0) <M+ \epsilon$

but for the limit we need all x greater than a number that
$|f(x) - M| < \epsilon$

For this specific example, we know that each top of $\sin x^2$ we have
satisfied $|f(x) - M| < \epsilon$ but NOT ALL!

## eg question from Dr. Chi-Kwong Fok about Weirestrass-Extream Value THM (continuous function in a compact set attains its max and min)

If f is a continuous and non-surjective function and the supremum of it
in \[0,$+\infty$\] is not in its range. show that \$\forall \epsilon
\>0, \forall x \> 0, \exists z \in R \text{ with } z \> x, \forall \$

Firstly, negate it: $\exists \epsilon_0 >0,$ s.t.
$\exists x_0 >0, \forall z \in R$ with z\>$x_0$, f(z) \$\leq
M-\epsilon\_0, \$ where M is sup R(f) ---(1)

Secondly, write down the def of M is sup:

$\forall \epsilon >0, \exists x\in [0,+ \infty],$ s.t.
f(x)\>$M-\epsilon$. Now take the global \$\epsilon \$ to be $\epsilon_0$
---(2)

By (1) and (2) we know that $\forall \epsilon >0, \exists x\in [0,x_0],$
s.t. f(x)\>$M-\epsilon$ Now take the global \$\epsilon \$ to be
$\epsilon_0$

By Weirestrass-Extream Value THM (continuous function in a compact set
attains its max and min) we know it attains its maximum in \[0,x_0\].
Suppose this maximum is not the sup, then M=supR(f) \< its maximum, then
by the IVP it must attain sup R(f) contradiction. =--also.

# a problem about divisible using greatest common factor to solve(even Bezou's theorem)

Q:"Proof that if a positive integer $p$ is not a perfect square, then
$\sqrt{p}$ is irrational."

Sol: Proof by Contradiction:

Assume $\sqrt{p}$ is rational.

Since $p$ is not a perfect square, there exist two coprime positive
integers $m$ and $n$ with $n > 1$ such that $$
\sqrt{p} = \frac{m}{n}
$$

Then $$
p = \frac{m^2}{n^2}
$$

which implies $$
m^2 = n^2 p
$$ i.e. $n^2 \mid m^2$. Then We want to show that $n \mid m$:

Suppose $m^2 = k n^2$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Since $m$ and $n$ are both integers, based on prime factorization, we
have:

$$
m = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}
$$

$$
n = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \cdots p_k^{b_k}
$$

where $p_i$ are prime numbers, and $a_i, b_i$ are non-negative integers.

So,

$$
m^2 = p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \cdots p_k^{2a_k}
$$

and

$$
n^2 = p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \cdots p_k^{2b_k}
$$

Since $m^2 = k n^2$, we have:

$$
p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \cdots p_k^{2a_k} = k \cdot p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \cdots p_k^{2b_k}
$$

This implies:

$$
2a_i \geq 2b_i \quad \text{for all } i
$$

So,

$$
a_i \geq b_i \quad \text{for all } i
$$

Thus, $m$ is divisible by $n$. Therefore, $n \mid m$, which is opposite
to m and n are coprime. So, $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational.

method 2: Proof by Contradiction:

Assume $\sqrt{p}$ is rational.

Since $p$ is not a perfect square, there exist two coprime positive
integers $m$ and $n$ with $n > 1$ such that $$
\sqrt{p} = \frac{m}{n}
$$

Then $$
p = \frac{m^2}{n^2}
$$

which implies $$
m^2 = n^2 p
$$ i.e. $n^2 \mid m^2$. So $n \mid m^2$

Since $n > 1$, it follows that there exists a prime number $r$ such that
$r \mid n$. (proof using Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:

Every integer greater than 1 is either a prime or can be uniquely
factored into prime numbers.

If $n$ is a prime number, then $r = n$ and clearly $r \mid n$;

If $n$ is not a prime number, it must be decomposable into a product of
prime factors. Therefore, we can write: $$
n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}
$$

where $p_i$ are prime numbers and $e_i$ are positive integers.

Since $n$ is a product of prime factors, at least one of these prime
factors $p_i$ must divide $n$.

Let $r = p_i$, which is one of the prime factors. Then $r \mid n$.

Thus, in both cases, whether $n$ is a prime or not, there exists at
least one prime number $r$ such that $r \mid n$.)

Thus $$
r \mid m^2 \quad \text{and} \quad r \mid m
$$ (proof of $$
r \mid m^2 \quad \text{and} \quad r \mid m
$$: proof1 using prime factorization as method 1's:

$r \mid m^2$ and r is a prime so $r=p_i$ corresponding to the
exponential of $2a_i$

since $a_i \geq 0$, so $a_i$ is at least 1 . proof2 using if r is a
prime and r\|ab, then r\|a or r\|b:

Suppose $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$ (contradiction assumption).

Let $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = d$ (where $d$ is the greatest common divisor
of $a \cdot b$ and $r$).

Since $d \mid r$, $d$ is a divisor of $r$ (since $r$ is a prime number).

Therefore, $d$ is either $r$ or $1$ (since $r$ is prime).

if $d = r$, we have $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = r$. This implies
$r \mid a \cdot b$.

Since we assumed $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$, it contradicts our initial
statement based on Properties of greatest common divisor with its proof
using Bezou's theorem;

If $d = 1$, we have $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = 1$. This implies
$r \nmid a \cdot b$, which contradicts our assumption that
$r \mid a \cdot b$.

Thus, the contradiction shows that our assumption $r \nmid a$ and
$r \nmid b$ must be false. Therefore, $r$ must divide at least one of
$a$ or $b$.

)

Since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, this leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, $\sqrt{p}$ must be an irrational number.
