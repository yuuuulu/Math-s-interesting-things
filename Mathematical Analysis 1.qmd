~p----read "not p"


#### Quantifiers

P: *some* a's are b's


~P: *all* a's are not b's/ no a's are b's 


P: *some* a are not b


~p: *all* a are b


#### Truth table: give the truth values of related statements in all possible cases
(relevant to boolean in computer science

```python
# Example of boolean logic in a program
is_raining = True
has_umbrella = False

if is_raining and not has_umbrella:
    print("You need an umbrella!")
else:
    print("You're good to go!")

```

compound statement: combining several statements via logical operations

Conjunction: p^q. p and q

Disjunction:
p v q--p or q 


one of them is true, p v q is true, so we only need to decide if oe of them is true, if it is, the p v q is true


p V (~p) is always true


a statement that is always true is called a tautology

# a problem about divisible using greatest common factor to solve(even Bezou's theorem)

Q:"Proof that if a positive integer $p$ is not a perfect square, then $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational."

Sol: Proof by Contradiction:

Assume $\sqrt{p}$ is rational. 

Since $p$ is not a perfect square, there exist two coprime positive integers $m$ and $n$ with $n > 1$ such that
$$
\sqrt{p} = \frac{m}{n}
$$

Then
$$
p = \frac{m^2}{n^2}
$$

which implies
$$
m^2 = n^2 p
$$
i.e. $n^2 \mid m^2$. Then We want to show that $n \mid m$:

Suppose $m^2 = k n^2$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Since $m$ and $n$ are both integers, based on prime factorization, we have:

$$
m = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}
$$

$$
n = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \cdots p_k^{b_k}
$$

where $p_i$ are prime numbers, and $a_i, b_i$ are non-negative integers.

So,

$$
m^2 = p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \cdots p_k^{2a_k}
$$

and

$$
n^2 = p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \cdots p_k^{2b_k}
$$

Since $m^2 = k n^2$, we have:

$$
p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \cdots p_k^{2a_k} = k \cdot p_1^{2b_1} p_2^{2b_2} \cdots p_k^{2b_k}
$$

This implies:

$$
2a_i \geq 2b_i \quad \text{for all } i
$$

So,

$$
a_i \geq b_i \quad \text{for all } i
$$

Thus, $m$ is divisible by $n$. Therefore, $n \mid m$, which is opposite to m and n are coprime. So, $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational.


method 2:
Proof by Contradiction:

Assume $\sqrt{p}$ is rational. 

Since $p$ is not a perfect square, there exist two coprime positive integers $m$ and $n$ with $n > 1$ such that
$$
\sqrt{p} = \frac{m}{n}
$$

Then
$$
p = \frac{m^2}{n^2}
$$

which implies
$$
m^2 = n^2 p
$$
i.e. $n^2 \mid m^2$. So  $n \mid m^2$


Since $n > 1$, it follows that there exists a prime number $r$ such that $r \mid n$.
(proof using Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:

Every integer greater than 1 is either a prime or can be uniquely factored into prime numbers.



If $n$ is a prime number, then $r = n$ and clearly $r \mid n$;


If $n$ is not a prime number, it must be decomposable into a product of prime factors. Therefore, we can write:
$$
n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}
$$

where $p_i$ are prime numbers and $e_i$ are positive integers.

Since $n$ is a product of prime factors, at least one of these prime factors $p_i$ must divide $n$.

Let $r = p_i$, which is one of the prime factors. Then $r \mid n$.

Thus, in both cases, whether $n$ is a prime or not, there exists at least one prime number $r$ such that $r \mid n$.)

Thus
$$
r \mid m^2 \quad \text{and} \quad r \mid m
$$
(proof of $$
r \mid m^2 \quad \text{and} \quad r \mid m
$$:
proof1 using prime factorization as method 1's:


$r \mid m^2$ and r is a prime so $r=p_i$ corresponding to the exponential of $2a_i$



since $a_i \geq 0$, so $a_i$ is at least 1 .
proof2 using if r is a prime and r|ab, then r|a or r|b:

Suppose $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$ (contradiction assumption).

Let $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = d$ (where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $a \cdot b$ and $r$).

Since $d \mid r$, $d$ is a divisor of $r$ (since $r$ is a prime number).

Therefore, $d$ is either $r$ or $1$ (since $r$ is prime).




if $d = r$, we have $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = r$. This implies $r \mid a \cdot b$. 

Since we assumed $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$, it contradicts our initial statement based on Properties of greatest common divisor with its proof using Bezou's theorem;


If $d = 1$, we have $\gcd(a \cdot b, r) = 1$. This implies $r \nmid a \cdot b$, which contradicts our assumption that $r \mid a \cdot b$.

Thus, the contradiction shows that our assumption $r \nmid a$ and $r \nmid b$ must be false. Therefore, $r$ must divide at least one of $a$ or $b$.

)

Since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, this leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, $\sqrt{p}$ must be an irrational number.
